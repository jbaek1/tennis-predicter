Who won the Australian Open in 2023?,"The Australian Open has been a home away from home for Novak Djokovic and Stefanos Tsitsipas throughout their respective careers. In Sunday's final, both men will chase major milestones in Rod Laver Arena, on a court that helped each rise to stardom. In addition to the Grand Slam glory at stake — Djokovic is playing for a record-tying 22nd men's singles major title, Tsitsipas for his very first — the final will also determine the new No. 1 in the Pepperstone ATP Rankings. Djokovic, who has spent a record 373 weeks as World No. 1, is bidding to return to the top spot for the first time since last June. Tsitsipas, in his first Australian Open final, is chasing a historic debut at the pinnacle of the men's game, with the opportunity to become the first Greek to hold the honour. With the sizable Greek and Serbian populations in Melbourne, a raucous atmosphere can be expected in the stands on Sunday. The tennis we've seen from the two competitors this season guarantees there will be fireworks on the court, too. Neither man has lost a match in 2023, with Djokovic 11-0 and Tsitsipas 10-0. Djokovic played two near-perfect matches as he breezed past Alex de Minaur (fourth round) and Grigor Dimitrov (quarters), his lingering hamstring injury firmly in the rearview mirror. He was again untouchable against Tommy Paul in the semi-finals, except for a late wobble in the opening set and a weary few moments early in the second — both of which could fuel Tsitsipas' belief heading into Sunday. Tsitsipas has also been otherworldly at times during his run, though he lost three sets to Djokovic's one in reaching the title round. Both times he was truly tested, he responded with a champion's resolve. The third seed now has an opportunity to avenge his defeat to Djokovic in the 2021 Roland Garros title match, when the Serbian battled back from two-sets-to-love down to lift the title. It was the first time in Djokovic's career that he managed such a comeback in a Slam final. After Jannik Sinner flipped their fourth-round match on its head, dominating sets three and four after Tsitsipas' blistering start, the Greek leaned on a sublime serving performance to claim the final set in one of the matches of the fortnight, escaping with a 6-4, 6-4, 3-6, 4-6, 6-3 victory. When Khachanov saved two match points in the semi-finals to force a fourth set, Tsitsipas again regrouped to seal his second Grand Slam final appearance.That Roland Garros win was the fifth of what is now nine straight for Djokovic in the pair's ATP Head2Head, in which he owns a decisive 10-2 advantage. The Serbian has won both of their Grand Slam meetings (their 2020 Paris semi-final also went five sets) and all four of their contests last season, dropping just one set in four matches. Djokovic has an equally impressive overall record dating back to his run to a fourth consecutive (and seventh overall) Wimbledon title in July. The Serbian is 37-2 since the start of the grass-court Slam, including his 11-0 mark in 2023. He has won five of a possible six tour-level titles in that span, including a record-tying sixth trophy at November's Nitto ATP Finals (matching Roger Federer) and the Adelaide International 1 crown earlier this season. Tsitsipas, who lost a 6-4, 7-6(4) decision to Djokovic in Turin, is seeking his first title since his Mallorca triumph last June, just before Wimbledon. But there is no better place for him to return to the winners' circle than Rod Laver Arena, the sight of his stunning 2019 upset of Federer — a result that put the Greek on the map as a then 20-year-old rising star. After defeats in his first three Melbourne semi-finals against Rafael Nadal (2019) and Daniil Medvedev (2021-22), Tsitsipas has broken new ground at what he calls his 'home Slam'. Having broken through that barrier, he now faces one of tennis' toughest test as he seeks the double prize on offer in Sunday's final. Days earlier, Djokovic momentarily forgot that the pair had met with a major title on the line. Tsitsipas, asked about that oversight in his post-semifinal presser, delivered a deadpan reply.

For Tsitsipas to succeed, he must deal Djokovic his first loss in an Australian Open semi-final or final. The Serbian will enter the title match with a 19-0 record in those two rounds in Melbourne, having lifted the trophy in each of his nine previous runs to the last four.",Novak Djokovic won the Australian Open in 2023.
Who won the Australian Open in 2022?,"History will be made on Sunday in the Australian Open final. But will it be because Rafael Nadal claimed a record-breaking 21st Grand Slam title or because Daniil Medvedev became the first man in the Open Era to earn his second major crown at the next Slam following his first? Entering the tournament, both men downplayed their chances. Nadal had only played five matches since Roland Garros last year due to a left foot injury. The 35-year-old was clear he had to “accept that things [are] not going to be perfect”. “I came here just with the clear goal to be back on the Tour,” Nadal said before the event. “That's the most important thing. Then if I am able to win matches, be improving every single day, fantastic.” The sixth seed was right. His tournament has not been perfect. This has not been like many of his Roland Garros runs, in which the lefty steamrolled the field en route to the trophy. But one thing no injury can take away from Nadal is his determination, and that has been on full display throughout the fortnight. In the quarter-finals against Denis Shapovalov, Nadal let slip a two-set lead and admitted to dealing with a stomach issue in the brutal Melbourne heat. But as he has often done throughout his career, the 89-time tour-level titlist relied on his unparalleled fighting spirit and found a way to win. Then in the semi-finals, when big-hitting Italian Matteo Berrettini appeared to have seized the momentum and turned their match around, Nadal once again battled through, triumphing in four sets to reach his sixth Australian Open final. The emotion on his face after match point as he smiled towards his box said it all. “I went through a lot of challenging moments, a lot of days of hard work without seeing a light there,” Nadal said. “But [I was] still working and still receiving plenty of support from my team and from my family, too, without a doubt.” Nadal is now three sets away from breaking his tie with Novak Djokovic and Roger Federer for the most men’s singles Grand Slam titles in history. The Spaniard can also become the fourth man in history to claim multiple crowns at all four majors. But earlier in the week, he was clear that his future happiness will not depend on finishing with more Slams than his great rivals. “No, I am super satisfied and feel [I am a] very lucky person in general for all the things that happened to me in this life,” Nadal said. “I have a way to approach life. You can't be always frustrated if the other, if the neighbour has a bigger house than you or a better phone or a better thing. I'm not going to be frustrated if Novak or Roger finishes their career with more Grand Slams than me.” Medvedev would be happy to halt Nadal’s historic pursuit. But the second-seeded Russian said he is not focussed on that. “It's not me going for the 21st, not me trying to break these records. I'm going for my second one. I'm still far from all these things,” Medvedev said. “I'm just trying to focus on myself, doing my job. Of course, I'm not lying, I know what's happening, I know what Rafa is going for, I knew what Novak was going for. I'm not gonna say, ‘Oh, yeah, I am trying not to listen about this.’ But it's kind of their thing, not mine. I'm just there to try to win the final.” Last September, Medvedev stopped Djokovic’s chase of the Grand Slam — winning all four majors in a single season — with a dominant display in the US Open final. Will he play spoiler again, but this time at Melbourne Park? Entering the tournament, the Russian star was one of the leading favourites if not the favourite as the highest-ranked player in the field and the most recent Grand Slam champion. But like Nadal, he attempted to shift the pressure off himself. ""I always say whoever is the highest ranked is the favourite,” Medvedev told Eurosport. “So this time I will go with Rafa because he has 20 Grand Slams."" Both men have earned their spot in the championship clash, which is a rematch of the 2019 US Open final. On that occasion, Nadal sprinted to a two-set lead with a break in the third set before Medvedev found his footing in his first major final and forced a fifth set. The Spaniard clawed his way to a grueling four-hour, 51-minute victory. “[I] have to give myself credit. I hope I grew a lot doing these things,” Medvedev said at the time. “But I need to continue and I need to be better.” The Russian has done just that. The 2020 Nitto ATP Finals champion has no clear weaknesses. At 6’6”, the 25-year-old often powers through service games at lightning speed before drowning opponents during his return games with jaw-dropping movement and defence. His strokes might look unconventional, but the results are unquestionable. Perhaps most importantly, Medvedev has developed a champion’s knack for raising his level when it matters most. Felix Auger-Aliassime played sensational tennis in the quarter-finals to take a two-set lead against him before the World No. 2 raised his game to rally for a spot in the last four, where he ousted rival Stefanos Tsitsipas in four sets. Medvedev thrives in the big moments. This is his fourth major final, and they have all come against legendary opponents, with two against Djokovic and this the second against Nadal. “It's really tough to get into the final, and I always have them there waiting for me. But it's fun,” Medvedev said. “When I was like eight, ten years old I was playing against the wall and I was imagining that it's Rafa on the other side, or Roger. Novak was still not yet there… “Now I have the chance to play [Rafa for the] second time. First one was a close one, epic one. I'm gonna try to prepare well, and need to show my best, because that's what I took of the three finals that I had before, that you have to do better than 100 per cent in order to win.” Nadal will throw everything but the Yarra River at Medvedev on Sunday. The sixth seed will launch forehand rockets, try to sneak forward if Medvedev stays far behind the baseline like he did at points in Flushing Meadows in 2019. But will it be enough? Rather than worrying about the result, the Spaniard plans to enjoy the moment. “Winning, it's special, yes, but winning without all the work that you have behind of course is not the same,” Nadal said. “If the things are easy, [they] don't have the same value. In my case, I think I have been able to enjoy it probably more than the other, because for a lot of times I was close to not being able to do it again.”",Rafael Nadal won the Australian Open in 2022.
Who won Roland Garros in 2022?,"It is master vs. apprentice for the title at Roland Garros.  Rafael Nadal and Casper Ruud may be facing off for the first time in Sunday’s championship match in Paris, but that doesn’t mean the pair doesn’t know a thing or two about each other.  Eighth seed Ruud has trained at the Spaniard's academy in Mallorca since September 2018, and that link has Nadal feeling extra positive as he bids for a 14th Roland Garros crown and record-extending 22nd Grand Slam title at 3pm local time (CEST).  ""I think in the academy we were able to help him a little bit during this period of time,” said the Spaniard after booking his spot in Sunday’s final at the clay-court major. “But more than [anything], as I always say, I like to see [a] good person achieving his dreams.  “I'm happy for him. I'm happy for his mum, dad. I know them very well. They are a super-healthy family and great people. As always, I am super happy when I see these great people having success.” For Ruud, facing his childhood idol for the first time would be an exciting challenge no matter the setting, but the Norwegian admitted it is a fitting climax to his dream run this fortnight in Paris.  “It is amazing...He is the last player of the Big 3 and the very top players in the world I have never played against,” said Ruud of Nadal after beating Marin Cilic on Friday to book his spot in a first major final. “So, I guess this is perfect timing and worth the wait. To finally play him in a Grand Slam final will be a special moment for me. Hopefully a little bit for him as well.  ""He has played so many finals, but at least he is playing a student from his academy this time. So, it is going to be a fun one hopefully.”  With Nadal chasing a record-extending 14th title in Paris and Ruud seeking a maiden Grand Slam crown, ATPTour.com looks at some key components behind Sunday’s championship match. Nadal has long been anointed one of the greatest players of all time, but the 36-year-old’s hunger for further Grand Slam success has burned as bright as ever this fortnight in Paris. Instead, the Spaniard’s major concern arriving in the French capital was how his body would hold up after he struggled with a chronic foot injury in defeat to Denis Shapovalov in Rome just over three weeks ago.  That has not stopped him coming through some gruelling battles on his way to a 14th final at Roland Garros. After opening with routine wins over Jordan Thompson, Corentin Moutet and Botic van de Zandschulp, Nadal edged a five-set thriller with Felix Auger-Aliassime before prevailing in a quarter-final classic against Novak Djokovic. The three hours spent on court before his opponent Alexander Zverev retired in the semi-finals brings Nadal’s time on court in his past three matches to 11 hours, 46 minutes, but the heavy workload is nothing new for the Spaniard.  ""Physically I'm OK,"" said Nadal in his press conference following the Zverev match. ""Normally my problem is not the physical performance…Of course today the conditions have been very hot, super humid. I know from experience that when these conditions happen, I suffer a little bit more in terms of [physicality]."" If Nadal can maintain his unbeaten record in championship matches at Roland Garros against Ruud, the 36-year-old will pass fellow Spaniard Andres Gimeno as the oldest Roland Garros men’s singles champion in history. After clinching a record 21st major title at the Australian Open in January, Nadal can move two Grand Slam crowns clear of Novak Djokovic and Roger Federer with victory on Sunday. The Serbian and Swiss are tied on 20 major trophies. A successful outcome for Nadal would also represent the first time he has completed the Australian Open-Roland Garros double in a calendar year.  Should he win, Nadal will draw level with current Tour leader Carlos Alcaraz’s four titles for 2022, having clinched trophies in Melbourne and Acapulco alongside his Australian Open triumph. A win-loss record of 111-3 at Roland Garros certainly suggests the Spaniard will be difficult to stop as he seeks to write yet more history in Paris. In contrast to Nadal’s familiarity with stepping onto Court Philippe Chatrier for a Roland Garros final, Ruud was in uncharted territory as early as his quarter-final clash with Holger Rune. The Norwegian had not been past the fourth round of a Grand Slam until this fortnight in Paris, but there were few signs of nerves from the 23-year-old as he recovered from a set down to oust Marin Cilic in the semi-finals.  Although Ruud’s longest match of the tournament was his opening three-hour, 49-minute win over Jo-Wilfried Tsonga, the Norwegian has spent 18 hours and two minutes on court in Paris, just six minutes fewer than Nadal overall. After downing Tsonga in four sets, the 23-year-old beat Emil Ruusuvuori, Lorenzo Sonego, Hubert Hurkacz, Rune and Cilic to become the first Norwegian to reach a Grand Slam final. Ruud can look to some promising numbers as he bids to become the first man to beat Nadal in a final at Roland Garros. The World No. 8 has fired 52 aces in the tournament so far compared to just 13 for Nadal, also striking more winners (259 to 204) and fewer unforced errors (138 to 166) than his opponent. The Ruud forehand in particular has developed into one of the most fearsome weapons on Tour, and the Norwegian will need it to fire if he wants to make a dent in the Nadal defence. Regardless of the result, Ruud will rise to a career-high No. 6 in the Pepperstone ATP Rankings on Monday. He has already picked up titles in Buenos Aires and Geneva this season and also reached a maiden ATP Masters 1000 final in Miami in March.  If he can find a way to get past Nadal, it would be the crowning achievement for three seasons of clay-court success for Ruud. The Norwegian has won 66 matches on the surface since 2020, 15 more than anyone else on Tour. Ruud’s strong displays have brought him seven tour-level titles on clay, but he is yet to lift a trophy above ATP 250 level. Yet even considering Nadal's own unrivalled record on the surface, the Spaniard will be wary of Ruud. “For me, [it] is not a big surprise,” said Nadal when asked about the eight-time tour-level titlist’s run in Paris. “Casper is one of the candidates [for] winning in every clay-court event that he's playing. [It’s] not a big surprise at all."" Nadal and Ruud’s clash will be the first Grand Slam final with a first-time meeting since the 2008 Australian Open championship match between Djokovic and Tsonga.",Rafael Nadal won Roland Garros in 2022.
Who won the US Open in 2022?,"There are high stakes matches, and then there is Sunday’s US Open championship match (4pm EDT/10pm CEST) between Carlos Alcaraz and Casper Ruud.  Both players stand one victory from their maiden Grand Slam crown, a feat that would simultaneously propel them to No. 1 in the Pepperstone ATP Rankings for the first time on Monday. The match is already a history-maker. It is the first Grand Slam men’s final featuring two players competing for both their first major title and the World No. 1 ranking, a winner-takes-all showdown set to bring the Grand Slam action for 2022 to a thrilling close.  “We're playing for the tournament and also World No. 1,” said Ruud after his semi-final win against Karen Khachanov on Friday. “Of course, there will be nerves and we will both feel it.” Depending on the result, another milestone will fall on Sunday night in New York. Ruud is aiming to become the first Norwegian man to win a Grand Slam title, while Alcaraz seeks to become the youngest No. 1 in the history of the Pepperstone ATP Rankings at the age of 19 years and four months. Read More On The Battle For No. 1. After not dropping a set in the first three matches of his US Open campaign, Alcaraz has taken a somewhat different path to victory from the fourth round onwards at Flushing Meadows.  The #NextGenATP Spaniard needed five sets to defeat Marin Cilic, Jannik Sinner and Frances Tiafoe in a trio of back-to-back thrillers, a clear demonstration of the physical strides made by the 19-year-old in recent months. A year ago in New York, he was forced to retire from his quarter-final against Felix Auger-Aliassime having come through tough five-setters in his two previous matches. As he prepares to take on Ruud on Arthur Ashe Stadium on Sunday, Alcaraz is not worried about his recent workload taking its toll.  “I would say now I'm more prepared [than last year],” said Alcaraz, who has spent 20 hours, 19 minutes on court in the tournament so far. “Last year I just played three Grand Slams before the US Open, and I had just played, I'm going to say, one match of five sets. Now I've played more matches of five sets, I am more prepared mentally and physically.” Should his meeting with Ruud also go the distance, Alcaraz can look back on an impressive 8-1 career record in fifth sets, something he attributes to his ability to raise his level when the pressure is ramped up.  “I lost one in Australia this year against Berrettini, but it could have been a victory for me too,” said Alcaraz. “The key moment is when I give my best. That's why I've won eight of the nine fifth sets I've played in my career. Today it has been shown that I am physically prepared to be able to play good tennis despite all the hours on the court. I'm not afraid of the final after qualifying like this. I will go for it."" The Spaniard will also look to his previous two meetings with Ruud for confidence. Alcaraz defeated the Norwegian on clay in Marbella in 2021, before securing another straight-sets victory in the final in Miami in March to lift his first ATP Masters 1000 crown.  “I feel capable of beating him again,” said Alcaraz. “He has already played a Grand Slam final, and for me everything will be new. But everything new in my career I have faced in a good way. I hope to do the same on Sunday. I'm going to try to show my best version"". Ruud’s run to his maiden major final at Roland Garros in July may have been abruptly ended by 22-time Grand Slam champion Rafael Nadal on the Parisian clay, but the Norwegian is viewing Sunday’s clash against Alcaraz with completely fresh eyes and believes the experience will even help when he steps onto Arthur Ashe Stadium on Sunday.  “I mean, Roland Garros, the final, [Nadal] obviously gave me a good beating,” said Ruud. “After the final I said, If I ever reach one again, I hope it is not Rafa on the other side of the court in Roland Garros, because it's sort of an impossible task I think for any player. I'm happy that it's not Rafa on clay.  “I hope it can have prepared me a little bit. At least I know a little bit what I'm facing when I'm stepping on the court, seeing the trophy on the back of the court, seeing tons of celebrities. Even in Roland Garros, there were royal families there watching. That was a little bit new experience for me. I hope I can be more ready for that on Sunday.”  Ruud has certainly been ready for whatever circumstances he has faced so far this fortnight in New York. The fifth seed kept cool to down home favourite Tommy Paul in five sets in the third round, while his quarter-final triumph against 13th seed Matteo Berrettini was in stark contrast to that battle. Ruud produced one of his most dominant displays of the year to ease past the big-hitting Italian in straight sets. The Norwegian believes he will have to play just as aggressively on Sunday if he wants to notch his first win against Alcaraz at the third attempt.  “I think if I want to beat Carlos, I'll need to play very precise with all the shots that I hit,” said Ruud. “Especially try to keep him a little bit further back in the court, to play with good depth and length on all my shots.  “If he steps in, he can do anything with the ball. He can rip a winner. He also has great touch with the dropshot. I think he has one of the best dropshots on tour. He can do both shots back and forth, it will sort of get you off guard sometimes with the dropshot.  “If you play with good depth and good length, it's tougher to hit dropshots. That will be something that I will try to focus on.”",Carlos Alcaraz won the US Open in 2022.
Who won Wimbledon in 2022?,"After a pulsating two weeks, Novak Djokovic and Nick Kyrgios will take to centre stage on Sunday in a mouthwatering clash in the Wimbledon final.  For Kyrgios the task at hand is great, with the Australian never been beyond the quarter-finals at a Grand Slam before this fortnight. In contrast, Djokovic will be competing in a record 32nd major final as he aims to capture his 21st Grand Slam crown.  However, Kyrgios is the game’s ultimate big-stage performer and with the weapons he possesses – a thunderous serve and powerful forehand – the 27-year-old will look to rise to the occasion and end his fairytale run with his first Grand Slam trophy.  “He plays lights-out every time he steps out onto the court,” Djokovic said when discussing Kyrgios. “Just [has] a lot of power in his serve and his game. So I'm sure he's going to go for it. No doubt he's going to be aggressive. I expect him to do that.  “He's a big-match player. If you see his career, the best tennis he's played is always against the top guys. That's why we all respect him, because we know what he can come up with. It's going to be [an] interesting match.” Kyrgios arrived in London high in confidence, having reached consecutive semi-finals on grass in Stuttgart and Halle. The World No. 40 has successfully transitioned his performances to the lawns in London, overcoming Paul Jubb, Filip Krajinovic, Stefanos Tsitsipas, Brandon Nakashima and Cristian Garin, before Rafael Nadal withdrew from their semi-final due to injury. Prior to Wimbledon, the six-time tour-level titlist had not reached the quarter-finals at a major since the 2015 Australian Open. Many, including the Aussie, believed his chances to win a major had gone, making his run in London extra special.  ""I just never thought that I would be [at this stage] at a Grand Slam. I thought that ship had sailed,” he said after his quarter-final win. “I didn’t go about things great earlier in my career and may have missed my window. I am really proud of the way I have come back out here.” Having put himself into a position to win the title, Kyrgios admitted on Friday that his nerves are building as he aims to show the world what he is capable of.  “I had a shocking sleep last night, though, to be honest. I probably got an hour's sleep just with everything, like the excitement. I had so much anxiety, I was already feeling so nervous, and I don't feel nervous usually,” Kyrgios said. “I just know there's a lot of people that want me to do well and give my best. But I had a shocking sleep last night. Hopefully I can get some sleep tonight.”  Although he may be sleep-deprived, Kyrgios can take comfort and encouragement from his standout record against top seed Djokovic, with the Australian leading the Serbian 2-0 in their ATP Head2Head Series. Kyrgios has won all four sets the pair has played, never dropped serve and faced just one break point. The 27-year-old, who defeated Rafael Nadal en route to the quarter-finals on debut at The Championships in 2014 and earned a win against Roger Federer in Madrid in 2015, will need to be firing on serve if he is going to breach the defences of Djokovic, who many views as the best returner to have played the sport.  The Australian, who is the lowest-ranked man to reach the Wimbledon final since World No. 48 Mark Philippoussis in 2003, has hammered 120 aces during the grass-court major, often hitting his spots on crucial points to dispatch opponents.  With history on the line, Djokovic will be ready for whatever Kyrgios throws at him when he walks onto Centre Court for his eighth final at The Championships.  The World No. 3 is chasing a fourth consecutive Wimbledon title and seventh overall, which would draw him level with American Pete Sampras and move him to within one of Federer (8). Following his four-set win over Cameron Norrie in the semi-finals, Djokovic improved to 85-10 at SW19, moving clear of Jimmy Connors (84-18) and into second in the all-time wins list.  “I'm aware of what's on the line. Every match, every Grand Slam that I get to play at this stage of my career, there is a lot on the line,” Djokovic said after defeating Norrie. “I don't know how many Grand Slam opportunities to win the trophy I will still have, as I will have in a few days. So, of course, I'm approaching it with [a] positive attitude and self-belief and willingness to win. There's no doubt about it.” Sunday’s final will be Djokovic’s fifth Grand Slam championship match in a row playing against someone who has never won a major. Last season he defeated Daniil Medvedev, Stefanos Tsitsipas and Matteo Berrettini in the first three finals of the year, before Medvedev gained revenge at the US Open to lift his maiden Grand Slam trophy.  Djokovic is expecting a tough battle against Kyrgios, but he is again ready to deal with the pressure he has become accustomed to.  “One thing for sure, there is going to be a lot of fireworks emotionally from both of us,” Djokovic said. “It is going to be his first Grand Slam final. He is very excited and he doesn’t have much to lose and he is always playing like that. He is playing so freely, one of the biggest serves in the game. Just a big game overall, a lot of power in his shots. We haven’t played for some time. I have never won a set off him. Hopefully it can be different this time.  ""It is another final here at Wimbledon at a tournament I love so much. Hopefully the experience can work in my favour.” After a testing fortnight, Djokovic stands one match away from creating more history at The All England Lawn Tennis Club as he looks to close the gap on 22-time major champion Nadal. Will the Serbian maintain his imperious Wimbledon record and earn a 28th consecutive match win and seventh crown, or will Kyrgios rise to the occasion as he so often does and upset the 87-time tour-level titlist? A victory for Kyrgios would see him become the first male Grand Slam champion from Australia since Lleyton Hewitt won the Wimbledon title in 2002.",Novak Djokovic won Wimbledon in 2022.
Who won the Australian Open in 2021?,"There are times when you almost feel sorry for them.  Seated courtside, innocently enough, wife Daria and coach Gilles Cervara are oftentimes on the receiving end of Daniil Medvedev’s rants, his mid-match diatribes, as he seeks some frustration relief.  With his charge heading into a telltale fifth set against Filip Krajinovic in the third round of the Australian Open, Cervara had seen and heard enough. Medvedev had never before won a five-setter. It was best for all concerned, thought the Frenchman, if he vacated the premises and let Medvedev figure things out on his own. The ploy worked. Medvedev went on to win, 6-3, 6-3, 4-6, 3-6, 6-0. But Cervara is the first to tell you that, when the Russian sounds off, it’s nothing personal. It’s just a glimpse into the Medvedev mind; him working out the puzzle in real-time.  “His game is like his personality — very different,” explained Cervara in 2019, as Medvedev surged toward his first major final at Flushing Meadows. “It’s like coaching a genius. Sometimes a genius, you don’t understand them. It’s like this. They’re different. And you have to connect to this guy like he is.”  John McEnroe, himself once an outside-the-box strategist prone to the occasional tirade, had a more Kasparovian comparison in mind: “He’s like a chess master.” Since that Slam breakthrough at the US Open, when he pushed Rafael Nadal to the brink in a final that stands among the finest ever played in the borough of Queens, Medvedev, 25, has been a model of consistency, a man of many streaks. He swept his last 10 matches of 2020, including seven Top 10 wins and titles at both the Rolex Paris Masters and the Nitto ATP Finals. Carrying that over into 2021, his winning streak is now at 20.  “It’s tough to keep this momentum going from London to Melbourne,” said Medvedev, who since becoming the highest-charting Russian since Nikolay Davydenko in 2008 (No. 4 in the FedEx ATP Rankings), has gone from hunter to hunted. “I’m just happy that I managed to keep my game on top. Of course, for the confidence, when you beat everybody, it’s just great, because I think people start maybe to be a little bit scared about you. At the same time, sometimes there are going to be some that are going to want to beat you even more. It’s a tricky situation.”  Now into the second Grand Slam final of his career, Medvedev is in for his biggest test yet in the form of eight-time champion Novak Djokovic. On paper, he’s out of his league. Djokovic, after all, is seeking his 18th major singles title, one that would narrow the gap between himself and Big Three brethren Nadal and Roger Federer; Medvedev is still in pursuit of his first.  While he may be the hotter player, this one he’ll have to earn the hard way. Despite suffering an abdominal injury in his five-set tussle with Taylor Fritz in the third round, Djokovic appears to be rounding into his familiar title-grabbing form. “Being in this situation before many times I think helps me kind of gather all the necessary elements for me to peak at the right time, which is happening again,” said Djokovic.  The top seed and two-time defending champion says he has no plans to hand over the title.  “When Novak says he’s not going to hand anything to somebody, I believe him,” said Medvedev, who convincingly straight-setted fifth seed Stefanos Tsitsipas in the semi-finals, 6-4, 6-2, 7-5. “I know that to beat him you need to show your best tennis, be at your best physically maybe four or five hours and be at your best mentally maybe for five hours.  “You never know how the match is going to go. To win a Slam, especially against somebody like Novak, is already a big motivation, and I don’t think there’s anything that can make it bigger. I like Novak. I appreciate him as a tennis player. So I don’t take these words as something negative. I’m quite motivated without those words. I have nothing to lose, to be honest.” Djokovic, 33, boasts a slight edge in ATP Head2Head encounters, 4-3, including a 6-4, 6-7(5), 6-2, 6-3 Round of 16 win on the hard courts of Melbourne Park in 2019. But it was Medvedev who claimed their most recent meeting at the 2020 Nitto ATP Finals, 6-3, 6-3. Should he find a way to outthink the World No. 1 again on Sunday, he will rise to No. 2 in the FedEx ATP Rankings, becoming the first player not named Djokovic, Nadal, Federer or Andy Murray to do so in a decade-and-a-half.  “Daniil Medvedev is the player to beat,” said Djokovic, who by defeating upstart Aslan Karatsev, 6-3, 6-4, 6-2, maintained his unbeaten record in Australian Open semi-finals (9-0). “He’s on a big winning streak. He ended out the [2020] season in the best possible fashion, winning quite comfortably against the top players, against myself in straight sets in London, and he just has improved a lot. He has a big serve. For a tall guy, he moves extremely well. Forehand maybe was his weaker shot, but he has improved that, as well. Backhand is as good as it gets. He’s so solid. He doesn’t give you much. He’s not afraid nowadays to attack and get to the net and take it to his opponents. He’s definitely a very smart tennis player.” Yes, Medvedev has the strokes, the firepower to give fits even to someone who’s owned Rod Laver Arena in recent years. But his best weapon might just be his mind.",Novak Djokovic won the Australian Open in 2021.
Who won Roland Garros in 2021?,"After two emotional, career-redefining semi-final victories – and two dramatic, action-packed weeks in Paris – it will be 18-time Grand Slam champion Novak Djokovic taking on Greece’s first major finalist Stefanos Tsitsipas for the Coupe des Mousquetaires crown at Roland Garros.  Fifth seed Tsitsipas broke new ground on the terre battue after fighting for three hours and 37 minutes against Alexander Zverev, claiming a hard-fought win in five sets 6-3, 6-3, 4-6, 4-6, 6-3 to reach his first Grand Slam final. But while Djokovic played fewer sets, he undoubtedly had the bigger mountain to climb in order to defeat 13-time Roland Garros champion Rafael Nadal.  It was kind of like climbing Mt. Everest, the 2016 champion said afterward. Djokovic’s four-set comeback became an instant classic after he rallied to win in four hours and 22 minutes 3-6, 6-3, 7-6(4), 6-2 to hand Nadal his third defeat in 108 matches at Stade Roland-Garros. “Each time you step on the court with him, you know that you have to kind of climb Mt. Everest to win against this guy here,” Djokovic said. “I won only once in our eight matches that we ever played in Chatrier here in Roland Garros. I tried to take some positives and some cues from that match in 2015 that I won against him to implement tonight, which worked out very nicely.  “It's just one of these matches that I really will remember for a very long time.”  By advancing to the final, Djokovic also claimed sole ownership of the second place on the all-time list for most Grand Slam men’s singles finals reached, ahead of Nadal. After a draining semi-final epic, how much does Djokovic have left in the tank? The toll of taking down Nadal on his home turf has spelled a bad omen for the few who have accomplished it: no one who has defeated Nadal at Roland Garros has gone on to win the title.   It’s a fact Djokovic himself knows all too well: after achieving the feat in the 2015 quarter-finals, he went on to lose to Stan Wawrinka in the championship match. And Robin Soderling, who defeated Nadal in 2009, was also eventually halted in the final by Roger Federer. “It's not the first time that I play an epic semifinal in a Grand Slam and then I have to come back in less than 48 hours and play [a] final,” Djokovic assured. “My recovery abilities are pretty good, I must say, throughout my career.   “Obviously my physiotherapist will try to do everything possible so I can be fresh. Because I played enough tennis, I don't need to train too much. It's really now just about taking things slowly until the day of the final.”  If Djokovic can find a way to hit the reset button and lift his second Roland Garros trophy, the ramifications could be huge – for Djokovic, for the Big Three's rivalry, and for the fate of the year-end No. 1 FedEx Ranking.   A triumph on Sunday would lift Djokovic to 19 Grand Slam titles and make him the first man in the Open Era – and only the third in history – to win every major title twice. Aussies Roy Emerson and Rod Laver are the only two men in the sport who have won each Grand Slam twice.  Not only would that write another stunning chapter in the tennis history books, it also means that by Wimbledon, Djokovic could be closing in on title No. 20 and locking in a three-way tie for the all-time record for most Grand Slam singles titles with Nadal and Federer. Djokovic, who extended his stay at No. 1 in the FedEx ATP Rankings this fortnight, can also eye a major move in the race for year-end No. 1 – which will be based solely on FedEx ATP Race To Turin points this year. Tsitsipas and Djokovic sit in first and second position, respectively, but that could potentially change as Sunday’s winner will be the Race leader.   Should Tsitsipas win, his lead over Djokovic and the rest of the field will grow by 800 points, putting him 990 points clear of the second position. But should Djokovic win, he would be in pole position for a record-breaking seventh Year-End No. 1 finish – ending his tie with Pete Sampras, who finished at the top of the Rankings for six years in a row between 1993-98.   Conventional wisdom says the Serbian’s long experience in championship matches will give him the edge over Tsitsipas. After all, the 18-time Grand Slam champion has already competed in 28 major finals, while this will be Tsitsipas’ – and Greece’s – first shot at major glory. Djokovic also leads the ATP Head2Head against Tsitsipas by a healthy 5-2 margin. But the signs have been coming together for Tsitsipas, even as he trails in their 3-0 clay-court Head2Head.    Both of their most recent clay-court meetings have been lengthy battles, including their clash in the quarter-finals at the Internazionali BNL d’Italia last month. Djokovic had to rally from a set down as Tsitsipas served for the match at 5-4 in the third set en route to a 4-6, 7-5, 7-5 win. At Roland Garros last year, Tsitsipas willed himself to a higher level after dropping the first two sets against Djokovic, pushing his opponent to the limit in their 6-3, 6-2, 5-7, 4-6, 6-1 battle.   Regardless of the tale of the tape, Tsitsipas won’t be the same player that Djokovic faced less than a year ago at this venue – and Djokovic knows it.   “I know what I need to do. Obviously Tsitsipas, [his] first time in the finals of a Grand Slam. For him it's a great achievement, but I'm sure he doesn't want to stop there,” Djokovic said. “He's in great form. He leads [the] Race rankings, this year. He's had his best results overall. I think he matured as a player a lot. Clay [is] arguably his best surface.  “We played an epic five-setter last year in the semis here. I know it's going to be another tough one. I'm hoping I can recharge my batteries as much as I can because I'm going to need some power and energy for that one.” While Djokovic recharges, Tsitsipas will try to recenter himself after pulling off the biggest victory of his career to reach the championship match a Grand Slam for the first time. The normally passionate Greek player has been totally serene throughout the fortnight – but after his mammoth five-setter against Zverev, he let the emotions flow out as he reflected on his historic achievement.   ""All I can think of is my roots,"" said Tsitsipas, as tears welled in his eyes during an on-court interview. ""I come from a really small place outside of Athens. My dream was to play here and I would never have thought I would achieve it…”  “It was nerve-wracking, so intense, I stayed alive. I went out there and fought. This win means a lot, it’s the most important one of my career so far.” In his post-match press conference, Tsitsipas elaborated: “It's reflecting back to the past. Roland Garros has been a historical tournament. It has been an event that I've been watching since I was little. My coach, it has been his favourite tournament. I grew up with him. It's a tournament that we always followed, we always watched. I was mostly emotional for putting myself in that position... For sure that's the first step. I haven't finalised it yet.”  That ‘yet’ and that ‘so far’ in his responses are indicative of Tsitsipas’ change in mentality, which has been evident throughout the fortnight and beyond as the Greek player racked up victory after victory.   In Paris, Tsitsipas stayed calm as he scaled his own 'mountains' – whether down a set and break points to 31st seed John Isner in the third round, or after losing the third and fourth sets to a zoned-in Zverev in the semi-finals. His never-say-die mentality and calm execution have led him to a tour-leading 39 victories on the season, including 22 clay-court wins. “I'm someone who fights. I was not willing to give up yet,” Tsitsipas said of his semi-final recovery. “I think I did [a] few things right that worked in my favor. I was still alive. I was still able to come back to the match.   “I was trying to be in a good relationship with myself and get encouraged and push forward for something good to happen. I knew I was not done at that point, I had more to give… All I had to do was put in the concentration.” But can Tsitsipas stay focussed against the World No. 1, across five grueling sets, to claim the biggest win of his career – for the second match in a row? The Greek will be bidding for only his second in against a World No. 1 in 10 attempts. Thankfully for Tsitsipas, that one previous win came against Djokovic himself, at the ATP Masters 1000 event in Shanghai back in 2019.   Back then, Tsitsipas had just turned 21 and was in the midst of his breakthrough season, during which he won the Nitto ATP Finals and rose to a career-high World No. 5 ranking. Now approaching 23, Tsitsipas is sending the message that he’s firmly settled into his place in the sport’s upper echelons.   Tsitsipas has already guaranteed himself a new career-high of World No. 4 by breaking his three-match semi-final losing streak and advancing to the championship match. He could go as high as No. 3 with a win over Djokovic, overtaking Nadal in the FedEx ATP Rankings. At 22 years 305 days, Tsitsipas is also one win away from becoming the youngest Grand Slam singles men’s champion since Juan Martin del Potro (20 years, 355 days) won the 2009 US Open, and the youngest Roland Garros men’s champion since Nadal (20 years, 5 days) won the title here in 2008.   But age, rankings, records and statistics… Those are just numbers to Tsitsipas, who vowed to play every point with everything he’s got when he faces Djokovic on Chatrier.  “I've never believed, have never really thought at what age that achievement might come, but I'm really happy with myself,” Tsitsipas reflected. “I think I've shown good discipline so far. I've been progressive.   “I'm looking forward on leaving my entire body on the court.”",Novak Djokovic won Roland Garros in 2021.
Who won Wimbledon in 2021?,"With history on the line, a mouthwatering clash awaits in the final match at The Championships, Wimbledon, as World No. 1 Novak Djokovic will take on seventh seed Matteo Berrettini for the Gentlemen’s Singles Trophy on Sunday.   The battle between 19-time Grand Slam champion Djokovic – who is going for his third consecutive major title of the year and contesting his 30th final – and Berrettini, a first-time Grand Slam finalist, is being billed as a ‘David vs Goliath’ type clash on Centre Court. But in our tale, David actually towers over Goliath at 6’5”, and Berrettini’s weapons – a booming serve and powerful forehand – can do quite a bit of damage on grass courts. The seventh-seeded Italian is riding an 11-match winning streak after lifting the cinch Championships trophy, his first ATP 500 triumph, in the build-up to Wimbledon.   “I'm just so, so happy for everything,” Berrettini said after his semi-final win. “My year started in a good way, with the finals in the ATP Cup. Then I got injured again. I kind of saw those ghosts again, of my body kind of struggling.   “Again, I came back stronger. I think I fully deserve to be here. I want to enjoy it like I did today. I want to enjoy my first final… I just appreciate what's happening.” After an injury-affected 2021 season, Berrettini is back at his best at the All England Club, where he is searching for his sixth tour-level trophy and his first at the Grand Slam level. He previously featured in the 2019 US Open semi-finals (l. to Nadal), but he is in uncharted territory after recording victories over Felix Auger-Aliassime and Hubert Hurkacz to reach the championship match.    A victory on Sunday would make Berrettini the first Italian man to lift a Grand Slam trophy since Adriano Panatta’s 1976 triumph at Roland Garros, and the first to do so at Wimbledon. But he’ll have to find a way past heavyweight Djokovic, the top seed, whom he trails 0-2 in their ATP Head2Head. Berrettini has never defeated a Top 10 player in a completed Grand Slam match; in Paris, he received a walkover from World No. 8 Roger Federer into the quarter-finals, where he met Djokovic.   Berrettini, still finding his feet after an abdominal injury kept him off the courts at the start of the season, managed to take one set from the eventual champion. The Italian got his big game going too late in a dramatic 6-3, 6-2, 6-7(5), 7-5 defeat on Court Philippe-Chatrier – he’ll be aiming for a faster start on Centre Court. Berrettini and his powerful serve will face a major challenge against Djokovic, one of the best returners in the game. The pace and precision of the World No. 1’s backhand will also provide a perfect counterbalance to the seventh seed’s heavy forehand when they settle into baseline battles.   “He's one of the best players in the world in the last 12 months, I think,” Djokovic assessed. “With big weapons in [the] serve and forehand, he can play well on any surface. Obviously, grass favours him even more, favours his game.   “If he serves big, as he did throughout the entire tournament, it's tough to break his serve. It's tough to go into the rhythm, to find a good positioning to return, make him play. But I believe in my return. I think [the] return has served me very well throughout my career."" Djokovic has looked more and more untouchable at SW19 since the tournament began as he looks to add another Grand Slam crown to his ever-growing haul. The World No. 1 has won 17 matches in a row in 2021, a streak that dates back to his Belgrade trophy and includes a historic Roland Garros triumph, where he became the first man in the Open Era to win all major titles twice.   On grass, it’s an even longer streak of success for Djokovic. His last defeat on the surface came at the hands of Marin Cilic in the 2018 Queen’s Club final – since then, he’s won 20 matches in a row, including back-to-back Wimbledon titles. He has only dropped one set this fortnight, against wild card Jack Draper in the first round, and aced big tests against former finalist Kevin Anderson and lefty Denis Shapovalov on the way to the final.  A third consecutive triumph, his sixth overall at Wimbledon, would bring him to 20 Grand Slams – tying the all-time record shared by Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal. “It would mean everything. That's why I'm here. That's why I'm playing,” Djokovic said after his semi-final victory. “I imagined myself being in a position to fight for another Grand Slam trophy prior to coming to London. I put myself in a very good position. Anything is possible in the finals. Obviously, experience is on my side.”  Perhaps in a sign of the times, it will be Djokovic’s third consecutive Grand Slam where he has not met another member of the Big Three – Federer or Nadal – in the championship match. In fact, since the start of 2019 all but three Grand Slams have featured finals with one 25-and-under player: Dominic Thiem, Daniil Medvedev, Alexander Zverev, Stefanos Tsitsipas and now Berrettini.  “I think that experience definitely favors me every single time,” Djokovic reflected. “Next time I get to work on the court, [I do so] knowing that I've been through everything that I could possibly go through as a tennis player. I know my strengths. I know what I'm capable of. I rely on that."" After a fortnight of chasing triumph and dodging disaster at the All England Club, Djokovic stands one match away from a monumental achievement. Can he continue fending off newer and younger challengers, or will Berrettini be the one to find a way to topple the 'giant' and seize the moment for himself?",Novak Djokovic won Wimbledon in 2021.
Who won the US Open in 2021?,"Daniil Medvedev is intent on denying Novak Djokovic’s bid to become just the third man to complete the Grand Slam in Sunday’s US Open final. But his motivation runs much deeper than becoming a footnote in tennis history.  After two runner-up finishes in major finals, the 25-year-old is more than ready to join the club of Grand Slam champions and begin building his own legacy on tennis' greatest stage.  Twice before he has done his level best to overcome heavy odds in a Grand Slam final: at Flushing Meadows two years ago, when he came close against Rafael Nadal and at this year’s Australian Open, where Djokovic comfortably had his measure. Should he snap the Serbian’s major winning streak one win shy of a flawless 28-0 in 2021, the historic spoiling act would count little to Medvedev when compared to the personal reward: a maiden Grand Slam trophy.  “I think from my side, of course… if I can make this, I'll probably be in the history books a little bit somewhere like not letting him do this. But I don't really care about it. I think it's more about him, that it affects him,” Medvedev said.  “From one side, for sure he's going to feel the pressure a little bit about it... From the other side, that’s what’s going to make him be even better in tough moments... Here we know that he will do everything to try to make it happen… I'm just going to throw it everything, and I'm definitely not going to be thinking about [his] Grand Slam or whatever.” Medvedev stands to become the first Russian man to triumph at this level since Marat Safin at the 2005 Australian Open. He has dropped just one set this campaign – to qualifier Botic van de Zandschulp in the quarter-finals – cruising past 24th seed Daniel Evans and 12th seed Felix Auger-Aliassime either side of that clash.  It has been a far more straightforward run to his second US Open final than two years ago, when only two of his six matches en route to the final came in straight sets. “Two years ago was a completely different tournament. First of all, the story with the fans. This year kind of didn't have anything. It was just smooth,” he said. “[In] 2019, actually before the story with the fans, I was cramping, couldn't almost walk in my second-round match. I managed to win it [d. Dellien], almost couldn't walk. There were some crazy matches, some crazy turnarounds.  “I remember playing against [Stan] Wawrinka, I tore my quadriceps… I managed to win the match. I had two days off, so I managed to heal it… This year I didn't have the stories, and that's a good thing. I have the experience of two finals of Slams that can help me… The only thing I can say is all that I have left, I'm going to throw it out on Sunday.” Djokovic leads the pair’s ATP Head2Head 5-3, including their only meeting this season for the first of his three majors this season. Before Medvedev’s straight-sets victory en route to the 2020 Nitto ATP Finals they had taken a set off each other in their previous four clashes, dating back to Djokovic’s fourth-round Australian Open win in 2019.  “It's going to be a battle against another guy who has been in tremendous form, Medvedev. He's won a lot of matches on hard court so far. We played earlier this year in the Australian Open final,” Djokovic said.  “He's already had a couple of Grand Slam finals behind him. I think experience-wise it's different for him now. I'm sure he's going to give it all to win it, to win his first Slam.  “On the other side, I'll be giving it all I possibly got in the tank to win this match. I'm focusing on recovery, recalibrating all the systems basically for Sunday. I'm not going to waste time or energy on anything that can just be a distraction and deplete me from the vital energy that I need.” Rod Laver – the last man to have completed the Grand Slam, in 1969 – watched on from the stands in Arthur Ashe Stadium on Friday night as Djokovic denied fourth seed Alexander Zverev in the semi-finals. It was an unprecedented 10th time in a major this year he had prevailed having dropped the opening set.  It was the fourth straight time he had done it this US Open after he stopped Kei Nishikori, Jenson Brooksby and Matteo Berrettini in succession. On top of the chance to match Laver’s feat, there was something more at stake for the World No. 1 – the chance to pull clear of his Big Three rivals with a 21st major trophy. “I’m going to put my heart, my soul, my body and my head into that one,” Djokovic said in his on-court interview on Friday night. “I’m going to treat that match like it’s the last match of my career.”  Djokovic made it clear his never-say-die reputation was built up over many years, having successfully found a way through crunch moments in the biggest matches time and again. It was a timely reminder for Medvedev ahead of the showdown on Sunday.  “Probably all these big matches that I won, big titles over the years, have kind of built that kind of aura around me that players know there's a never-die spirit with me, especially when I play Grand Slams,” Djokovic said. “They know that until the last shot things can turn around, which was the case in several occasions throughout my career.  “So I'm glad that my opponents think of me that way. I want them to feel that they are under extreme pressure when I'm facing them on a big stage in Grand Slams.”",Daniil Medvedev won the US Open in 2021.
Who won the Australian Open in 2020?,"Seven-time champion Novak Djokovic has lifted the Australian Open trophy more times than anyone else in history, and he has enjoyed one of his most dominant runs ever to reach the final this year. But Austrian superstar Dominic Thiem has been on a tear in Melbourne, lashing his groundstrokes through anyone standing in his way of a maiden Grand Slam championship. The question is, will Djokovic maintain his iron grip on the Norman Brookes Challenge Cup with another flawless performance, or will Thiem soar to new heights and complete his dream run?  Djokovic and Thiem will meet for the 11th time in their FedEx ATP Head2Head series on Sunday evening on Rod Laver Arena, but the stakes have never been higher. The Serbian, who leads their series 6-4, is trying to extend his record to eight Australian Open crowns, earning his 17th major title to claw closer to Roger Federer (20) and Rafael Nadal’s (19) all-time marks. Although Thiem has won four of their past five clashes, defeating Djokovic in Melbourne is an entirely different challenge. “I won more of the [most recent] encounters than he did. But I think it doesn't count so much. It's absolutely his comfort zone here. He always plays his best tennis in Australia since many, many years. So I'm expecting that as well in the final,” Thiem said. “All I can do is do my best, play great tennis again, and of course take a look at the past matches we had… try to repeat the good stuff that I did there.”  If Djokovic becomes the third man to win at least eight titles at the same Grand Slam, joining Nadal (Roland Garros, 12) and Federer (Wimbledon, 8), he will also regain the No. 1 FedEx ATP Ranking on Monday. But the second seed, who has never lost an Australian Open semi-final or final (15-0), knows he will face one of the most dangerous players on the ATP Tour. Thiem earned his first hard-court victory against Djokovic at last year’s Nitto ATP Finals, where he raised his aggression to incredibly high levels to do something few players are able to, hitting through the Serbian’s defences. “Probably it was maybe the best match I ever played. It was a real classic and epic match,” Thiem said at the time.  Djokovic has followed Thiem’s run in Melbourne, where he is into his maiden Slam final on hard court, and the World No. 2 knows he will have to be at his best in a match that projects to be between one of the most relentless attackers in the game and its best defender.  “Dominic won our last match we played against each other, a close one in London. He played a terrific match against Rafa last night. I watched that. Definitely one of the best players in the world. Deserves to be where he is,” Djokovic said. “It seems like he's improved his game a lot on hard courts, because his game is more suitable to the slower surfaces.”   Thiem won three of his five titles in 2019 on hard court, including his first ATP Masters 1000 victory at Indian Wells. And if he is to become the second player (Wawrinka, 2014 Australian Open) to beat both Djokovic and Nadal at the same major, the Austrian will need to continue flattening out his shots and stepping into the court, which has helped his improvement on the surface.  “I think I have to keep a good balance. Of course, I have to risk a lot. I have to go for many shots. At the same time, of course, not too much. That's a very thin line. In the last match against him, hit that line perfectly in London,” Thiem said. “But for sure he's the favourite. He’s won seven titles here, never lost a final, going for his eighth one. I'm feeling good on the court. I'm playing great tennis. So [I’ll] try to be at my absolute best on Sunday.” Djokovic is not in new territory, getting set to play in his 26th Grand Slam final (16-9). But Thiem, a two-time Roland Garros finalist, is trying to make his biggest breakthrough yet. If he springs the upset, he will become the first player born in the 1990s to win a major, and just the second Austrian to do so, joining former World No. 1 Thomas Muster. A victory will also send him to a career-high World No. 3.  “It's just a matter of one match here and there that can potentially give him a Grand Slam title, that he can actually get in the mix of top three in the world,” Djokovic said. “He definitely has the game. He has the experience now. He has the strength. He has all the means to really be there. He has improved in the past 12 months playing on the hard court without a doubt, and the results are showing that.”   Thiem has proven to play as physical of a game as anyone on the ATP Tour. But Djokovic (12 hours, 29 minutes) has spent nearly six hours less than his opponent (18 hours, 24 minutes) on court throughout the tournament, and he will look to wear the fifth seed down with his elastic defence. Thiem, however, feels ready for the occasion.  “With all the adrenaline and everything, it's going to be fine. I played two super intense matches against Rafa and now against Sascha. So of course I'm going to feel it, especially tomorrow,” Thiem said. “But [I’m] going to have great treatment, [an] easy hit tomorrow, and then of course try everything to be 100 per cent on Sunday night.” Djokovic presents plenty of challenges, no matter what Thiem brings to his table. The 32-year-old shrinks the court, forcing even his most aggressive opponents to go for more than they are comfortable with. In the meantime, he waits for any short balls to pounce and take control of rallies himself. This fortnight, Djokovic has been serving tremendously well, too, winning 82 per cent of his first-serve points.  Djokovic remains undefeated in 2020, after winning all six of his singles matches at the inaugural ATP Cup to work his way into form and gain confidence heading into the Australian Open.  “I'm pleased with the way I've been feeling and playing,” Djokovic said. “I thought the ATP Cup went really well for me. I got a lot of hours spent on the court, singles and doubles. It was a great lead-up for the Australian Open. Obviously, I got a lot of positive energy from that competition. I dropped only one set so far up to the final.”  To be the best, you’ve got to beat the best, and in Melbourne, that has long been Djokovic. Will Thiem be up for the challenge?",Novak Djokovic won the Australian Open in 2020.
Who won Roland Garros in 2020?,"When Novak Djokovic and Rafael Nadal step onto Court Philippe-Chatrier on Sunday, they will be contesting one of the most important matches in their storied ATP Head2Head rivalry.  The top two players in the FedEx ATP Rankings have battled for the biggest titles on the grandest stages in the sport since their first meeting at this event in 2006, but their eighth clash on the Parisian terre battue (Nadal leads 6-1) and their 56th ATP Head2Head encounter (Djokovic leads 29-26) has added importance. Both men are chasing Grand Slam history. On one side of the net, Djokovic is aiming to become the first man in the Open Era to win all four Grand Slam titles on multiple occasions. A win would also see him move just one major title away from Nadal and two behind record holder and 20-time Grand Slam champion Roger Federer.  “I've played [Rafa] more than I [have] played any other player in my professional career,” said Djokovic. “Our head-to-head is the biggest head-to-head ever in the history of the sport. The amount of matches we played is almost 60 matches… He's definitely my greatest rival.” For the first time, Nadal is one win away from equalling Federer’s Grand Slam titles record. The 19-time major titlist will be aiming to add a record-extending 13th Roland Garros crown to his collection and become the first player to win 100 matches at Roland Garros (99-2).  ”To play against Novak, I need to play my best. Without playing my best tennis, [the] situation is very difficult,” said Nadal. “I know this is a court that I have been playing well [on] for such a long time, so that helps. But at the same time, he has an amazing record here too, being in the final rounds almost every single time."" In the early stages of their rivalry, Nadal owned a clear edge. The Mallorcan dominated the centre of the court with his forehand and used his greater experience to claim 14 victories from his opening 18 clashes against Djokovic.  In recent times, Djokovic has mirrored that record. The Serbian has won 14 of their 18 most recent contests by imposing his brand of tennis on Nadal. Djokovic has improved his serve, which has helped push Nadal behind the baseline and into defensive positions. The World No. 1 has also used his backhand to great effect, taking Nadal’s heavily spun forehand in his stride and firing the ball crosscourt and down the line with high levels of consistency.  ”[He] is one of the toughest opponents possible. But I am here to keep trying my best,” said Nadal. “I like to play in this scenario. I know I have to make a step forward. I think I did one [on Friday]. But for Sunday [it] is not enough. I need to make another one. That's what I'm looking for. I [am] going to work hard to try to make that happen.”  Conditions have often played a key part in the outcome of Djokovic and Nadal’s matches. Djokovic has dominated his rival on hard courts, winning all of their past nine meetings on the surface in straight sets.  But Nadal owns the crucial advantage on clay. The 12-time champion holds a 17-7 record against his rival on the dirt, including wins in their past three meetings on the surface at ATP Masters 1000 events in Rome and Madrid. Due to the tournament’s position in the calendar this year, the cold conditions in Paris could influence the pair’s record-equalling ninth major final. Djokovic and Nadal both own four victories against each other in Grand Slam championship matches.  “We all know that the conditions and the circumstances are obviously different from what we are used to. It's going to be interesting to see how his game and my game match up, how it all plays out on Sunday,” said Djokovic.  “Depending on what the temperature is as well. That affects a lot the court, whether it's heavy, not bouncing much, slippery, windy. All these things can affect I think both of us mentally and our games.”  En route to the quarter-finals, Djokovic claimed four straight-sets victories and spent just seven hours and 32 minutes on court. In his past two matches against Pablo Carreno Busta and Stefanos Tsitsipas, the 2016 champion needed a combined seven hours and four minutes to reach his fifth Roland Garros final (1-3).  Despite struggling with neck and shoulder issues against Carreno Busta, Djokovic expressed confidence on Friday that he would have no issues recovering in time for his third Roland Garros final against Nadal (Nadal leads 2-0).  “I'm not feeling exhausted physically so much after tonight's match, obviously [the match lasted] almost four hours,"" said Djokovic on Friday. ""It was a great battle. But I feel fine. I think a day and a half will be plenty of time for me to recover. I'm really looking forward to a great battle with Rafa.” Nadal’s path to the final has been more straightforward. For the sixth time, the second seed has made it to the final in Paris without dropping a set. But Nadal has still been tested during the event. In the third set of his semi-final clash against Diego Schwartzman, the 34-year-old twice surrendered a break advantage and was forced to save three break points serving at 5-5.  “Going through these moments playing that aggressive with the forehand, knowing that you can have success like this, makes me feel positive and makes me feel confident. That helps, of course, for the future,” said Nadal.  As one of only two men to have defeated Nadal at Roland Garros, alongside Sweden’s Robin Soderling, Djokovic will use his straight-sets win against Nadal in the 2015 quarter-finals for inspiration. With a 37-1 record this year, the top seed is in peak form. The question is, can he rise to the occasion and overcome one of the biggest challenges in sport for the second time?  “I'm in the last match of the tournament, playing against the biggest rival, the biggest obstacle and challenge that you can have. This is what it comes down to,” said Djokovic.  “I've been there. I've done it. I understand what needs to be done and how I need to prepare myself. I'm looking forward to it.”",Rafael Nadal won Roland Garros in 2020.
Who won the US Open in 2020?,"Second seed Dominic Thiem and fifth seed Alexander Zverev have in recent years become familiar with facing each other in the biggest events on Tour. The pair of talented young stars take their rivalry to new heights on Sunday as they each look to win their maiden Grand Slam title in the US Open final.  ”When you start playing tennis at a young age, the thing that you always wanted to do is play in big tournaments [and] the big finals. I feel like this is the reason I started playing tennis,” Zverev said. “You’ve got to be able to handle it… For me, it was always about the big moments in big tournaments.” Thiem leads Zverev 7-2 in their ATP Head2Head series and won their past three matches, including a four-set triumph in this year’s Australian Open semi-finals. Both players hit more winners than unforced errors that night in producing arguably the highest-quality match to date in their rivalry.  It’s a level that Thiem was far from a few weeks ago as he crashed out in his opening match at the Western & Southern Open. The 27-year-old gradually found his form this tournament and is now in full flight, winning his past three matches without dropping a set. Thiem’s mental toughness was also on display in his semi-final with Daniil Medvedev as he saved a set point in the second and third sets.  Unlike his three previous Grand Slam finals against Rafael Nadal or Novak Djokovic, he'll arrive as the on-paper favourite against Zverev. But despite his favourable record, Thiem will put history aside and approach the match with a clean slate.  ”I won’t change my mindset at all. I know what Sascha is capable of,” Thiem said. “He’s a hell of a player. One of the greatest ones in [the] past years. Won all titles besides a major. He will also try everything that he’s capable of doing to win the title. It’s going to be a super difficult match."" Thiem leads the tournament in return games won (32/82, 39%) and will look to apply pressure on Zverev’s serve, which has been prone to spurts of double faults. Although he shines in long baseline rallies, Thiem has also shown a greater willingness to finish points at net. That could serve him well as he hopes to avoid testing a minor right ankle injury that he sustained against Medvedev.  Zverev had struggled with internal and external pressure at Grand Slams, but broke free from that this year. After achieving his first Grand Slam semi-final in Melbourne, the 23-year-old is the youngest player to reach the US Open final since Djokovic in 2008. Should he prevail on Sunday, he’ll become the youngest major winner since a 20-year-old Juan Martin del Potro at this event in 2009.  The German showed impressive mental toughness in shaking off slow starts during his quarter-final and semi-final matches. He rallied from a set and a break down against Borna Coric in the quarter-finals, then fought back from two sets down against Pablo Carreno Busta to reach the final. His fitness is also evident in continuing to bounce back from long matches. Zverev’s average match time this fortnight has exceeded three hours. Although his comebacks have been admirable, Zverev can’t afford to start slowly against Thiem. He’ll need to use his serve and forehand to keep the points short and avoid lengthy rallies with the tireless Austrian. The longer the match goes, the more it will likely swing in favor of Thiem, who produced a 15-3 record last year in deciding sets.  But perhaps the biggest factor will be who handles the occasion better. Thiem will have to erase the memories of his previous defeats in Grand Slam finals and Zverev will need to handle his nerves as he plays the biggest match of his career. The Austrian will also face his first major final without any fans. Although Thiem has adapted well to the unique atmosphere, he fed off vocal crowds throughout his three previous Grand Slams finals and will need to draw energy from elsewhere.  ”It’s the biggest goal and also the biggest dream I’ve had in my tennis career for a few years now,” Thiem said. “Of course, it's pressure for me. At the same time, I try to think not too much about it. If it's not going to happen on Sunday, I have to continue working and maybe get the chance at another Slam. [But] the chance is now… I’ll try everything to make it.”",Dominic Thiem won the US Open in 2020.
Who won the Australian Open in 2019?,"Seven years ago, Novak Djokovic and Rafael Nadal battled for five hours and 53 minutes on Rod Laver Arena in the Australian Open final. That clash remains the longest Grand Slam final in history, as well as the longest match of both players’ careers. There were 369 points played, 11 breaks of serve, classic rallies and barely a blink of an eye.  But there wasn’t only one winner. Djokovic may have emerged victorious from the match, lifting his third of what is now six Norman Brookes Challenge Cups in his trophy case. Nadal showed his fighting spirit and champion’s grit, leaving everything on the court as he always does. But tennis was the true winner that day. And the same should be the case on Sunday, as the pair faces off in what promises to be another all-time classic.  “These are the kind of matches that you live for, finals of Slams, playing the greatest rivals at their best,” Djokovic said. “What more can you ask for? This is where you want to be.” Djokovic is trying to win his record seventh Australian Open title (tied w/Federer & Emerson with six) and claim his third consecutive major for the third time. The Serbian can also break a tie with Pete Sampras for the third-most Slam titles all-time, as they both own 14. Nadal is trying to become the first player in the Open Era to clinch the career Grand Slam twice. He can also earn his 18th major crown to move within two titles of Roger Federer's record 20.  “We push each other to the limit of our tennis level,” Nadal said. “Tomorrow is going to be another episode.  “I think I found solutions against Novak during all my career, and he found solutions against me. It’s always about moments. In his best moments, he's so difficult to beat. In my best moments, I have been a tough opponent, too.” While Djokovic and Nadal have met 52 times in their FedEx ATP Head2Head series — more than any other pair of players in history — the 2012 final was their lone match at the Australian Open. So with that epic in mind, there is plenty of anticipation as top-seeded Djokovic and 2009 champion Nadal get set for their eighth Grand Slam final match-up.  For the seventh time, Nadal is into a major championship match without dropping a set. On each of the previous six occasions, the Spaniard has gone on to lift the trophy.   That may be mildly surprising considering Nadal arrived at Melbourne Park without competing since last year’s US Open semi-final, in which he retired due to injury. The World No. 2’s longest match by time came in the third round, in which he beat #NextGenATP Aussie Alex de Minaur 6-1, 6-2, 6-4 in two hours and 22 minutes.  His most impressive performance, however, came in the semi-finals. Reigning Next Gen ATP Finals champion Stefanos Tsitsipas entered the last four straight off back-to-back wins against six-time Melbourne titlist Roger Federer and in-form Spaniard Roberto Bautista Agut. But Nadal lost just six games against the Greek to advance to his fifth final at the year’s first Grand Slam.  “He has played impressively well throughout the entire tournament. He hasn't dropped a set. He looked as good as ever on the hard court throughout these few weeks,"" Djokovic said. ""I haven't played bad myself [my] past couple matches. I think that this final comes at the right time for both of us. I'm sure we're going to have a blast on the court.” Djokovic had lost two sets heading into his semi-final against Pouille. But the Serbian took notice of Nadal’s performance on Thursday evening and produced his best effort of the fortnight on Friday, dropping just four games. It was just the seventh time in the Open Era that a man had lost four games or less in a major semi-final.  Was he trying to concede fewer games than Nadal?  “Yes. It was hard to do that, but somehow I managed [it],” Djokovic said, cracking a smile. As always, it will be fascinating to watch the baseline battles between the pair. Nadal, using his recently-tweaked serve with success during the tournament to take control earlier in rallies, will look to take a crack as early in points and as far inside the court as possible. On the other side, Djokovic will use his pretzel-like flexibility to neutralise those attacks and step into the court. It never gets tiresome to see cross-court rallies between Nadal’s forehand and Djokovic’s backhand, two of the best shots in the sport. This time last year, Djokovic was struggling with a right elbow injury, one that forced him to undergo a procedure after the Australian Open. The Serbian would start 2018 with a 6-6 record. But after winning Wimbledon, completing his Career Golden Masters at Cincinnati and triumphing at the US Open, Djokovic now has a chance to win his third major in a row. And while it will surely be difficult against Nadal, he cherishes these moments.   ""There's so much at stake, it's hard to pick one thing. Obviously making history of the sport that I love is an honour and is a privilege. It's a huge motivation,"" Djokovic said. ""At the same time Nadal is across the net. We're playing [the] final of a Grand Slam for the record seventh title here. If you don't get motivated by all these things, then something is wrong.""",Novak Djokovic won the Australian Open in 2019.
Who won Roland Garros in 2019?,"Rafael Nadal and Dominic Thiem have taken markedly different paths this fortnight, but find themselves in the same place. After weathering swirling winds, flying umbrellas and stiff challenges from the world’s best players, the second-seeded Spaniard and fourth-seeded Austrian meet on Sunday for the Roland Garros title. The 25-year-old Thiem is aware of the challenge he faces in toppling the greatest clay-court player of all time in Court Philippe-Chatrier. But having reached the final here last year, he won’t be content with simply making it to another championship match.  “To play Rafa here on this court is always the ultimate challenge, one of the toughest challenges in sports,” said Thiem. “I think it's really important that I go into the match with the belief to win. That's the most important thing. It’s a big dream for me to win this match, to win this title.”  Eleven-time champion Nadal leads his FedEx ATP Head2Head rivalry with Thiem 8-4, but the Austrian has scored a clay-court win over Nadal each of the past four years, including their most recent meeting this April in the Barcelona Open Banc Sabadell semi-finals. He’s the only player in that time to defeat the Spaniard more than once on this surface and joins Novak Djokovic as the only players with at least four clay-court victories over Nadal. It’s a different story at Roland Garros, though. Nadal has swept all three matches and nine sets they’ve played here, including last year’s final. Although the second seed has history on his side, he’s approaching tomorrow’s battle with a clean slate  “In a final like this one, the opponent is always at a very high level, but that's the rule of sports. That's why this sport is even more interesting,” said Nadal. “I think that I'm confident in myself. If I'm not able to execute my game plan, it's going to be complicated. But if I play well, and I have played well up to now, I've got all my chances. But it's always a match and anything can happen.”  Nadal’s eye-raising credentials at the second major of the year are well-documented. He holds a staggering 92-2 record here and has won the title in 11 of his past 14 appearances. The Spaniard gets even more dangerous at the business end at this event. His Grand Slam final record is a combined 6-8 at the other three majors, but a flawless 11-0 in Paris. It was hardly a guarantee that Nadal would make it back to the final Sunday this year. He started his clay-court season with three consecutive semi-final losses, falling to Fabio Fognini at the Rolex Monte-Carlo Masters, Thiem in Barcelona and Stefanos Tsitsipas at the Mutua Madrid Open. Critics were quick to wonder if the Spaniard’s reign of dominance on clay had come to end.  The Spaniard silenced his doubters over the past four weeks. He defeated Djokovic for his 34th ATP Masters 1000 title at the Internazionali BNL d’Italia and has been in dominant form this fortnight. Nadal dropped a set in his third-round win over David Goffin, but lost an average of seven games in his other five matches.  “Being in the final of Roland Garros again means a lot and especially coming back from a tough situation with all the injuries that I had,” said Nadal. “Being able to recover the level that I had the past couple of weeks is something that I am very proud of. I’m just focused on keeping going and doing my thing well.” Although Thiem took the title in Barcelona (d. Medvedev), early exits in Monte-Carlo and Rome put a question mark on whether he’d bring his top form to Paris. He struggled early in the tournament, dropping sets in each of his first three matches.  But Thiem found a new gear in the second week. He posted convincing scorelines over Gael Monfils and Karen Khachanov before his five-set semi-final victory over Djokovic that spanned two days. Saturday's win made Thiem the first Austrian player to reach multiple Grand Slam finals. Thiem has been quick to reject suggestions that fitness could play a factor in Sunday’s match. Thiem has spent 15 hours and 25 minutes on court this fortnight, compared to 13 hours and 24 minutes on Nadal, and will compete for the fourth straight day on Sunday. But with a chance at his first Grand Slam title on the line, he’s prepared for one last push.  “I'm feeling fine. I'm full of adrenaline from today's match and will have that tomorrow,” said Thiem. “I'm not going to be tired. It's all going to come after the tournament. I'm ready to leave everything that I have out on the court tomorrow.”",Rafael Nadal won Roland Garros in 2019.
Who won Wimbledon in 2019?,"Novak Djokovic and Roger Federer’s legendary rivalry gets another chapter on Sunday when they face off for the Wimbledon title. Both men have become synonymous with championship matches at The All England Club. At least one of them has made it to the final Sunday in all but two editions of The Championships since 2003.  “It’s the final of Wimbledon. This is the kind of match that I always dreamed of being part of as a young boy with the tennis racquet. This is what I worked for. I wanted to be in this position,” said Djokovic. “I have a chance to fight for a trophy. Regardless of who's across the net or what is happening, I'll definitely give it my all.” Top seed and defending champion Djokovic leads second seed Federer 25-22 in their FedEx ATP Head2Head series. They have the second-most prolific rivalry in the Open Era, only trailing Djokovic-Nadal (54 matches). Federer and Djokovic have squared off in 13 of the 14 most recent seasons on the ATP Tour, but the Serbian has gotten the upper hand lately, winning their past four matches. Djokovic also leads their grass-court series 2-1, prevailing in the 2014 and 2015 Wimbledon finals.  Their recent battles have still been highly competitive, though. Djokovic’s victory over Federer at the 2018 Rolex Paris Masters was named “Best Match Of 2018” by ATPTour.com.  Their familiarity with each other means there will be no secrets when they take to Centre Court. Djokovic knows what he must do to beat Federer, and vice-versa. It will come down to who can execute their game plan most effectively.   “I think the moment you've played somebody more than 15 times, there's not that much more left out there. You know where the players go when it really matters,” said Federer. “I don't think there's much I need to do in terms of practice. This is like school: You're not going to read lots of books on the day of the test. You don't have the time. It’s quite clear the work was done way before.”  The two finalists carry different playing styles and personalities, but their paths to Sunday’s final have been similar. Federer and Djokovic each dropped two sets this fortnight, one in the first week and another in the second set of their respective semi-finals, Djokovic against Roberto Bautista Agut and Federer against Rafael Nadal. They’ve also hit more winners than unforced errors in all of their matches this fortnight. Federer and Djokovic’s dominance for well over a decade makes it easy to forget that they’re both at an age when many of their contemporaries have either slowed down or retired. The 32-year-old Djokovic is looking to win his fourth major title since turning 30, something that only Federer, Nadal and Rod Laver have accomplished in the Open Era. A win on Sunday would also make the Serbian the first man in the Open Era over age 30 to successfully defend a Wimbledon title.  But Djokovic knows that to make history, he must beat history. With eight Wimbledon titles to his name, Federer is considered by many to be greatest grass-court player of all time. The ways in which he gives the World No. 1 trouble are amplified even further on this surface. “We all know how good he is anywhere, but especially here. This surface complements his game very much. He loves to play very fast. Takes away the time from his opponent. Just doesn't give you any of the same looks. He rushes you to everything,” said Djokovic. “For players like Nadal or myself that like to have a little more time, it's a constant pressure that you have to deal with.”  Meanwhile, Federer could become the oldest man (37 years, 340 days) in the Open Era to win a Grand Slam singles title. He’s already made history this fortnight by becoming the first man to win 100 matches at a Grand Slam with his quarter-final victory over Kei Nishikori. Reaching his 12th Wimbledon final at age 37 is a mind-boggling achievement on its own. But with 20 major titles to his name already, Federer won’t be content with a runner-up finish. The Swiss believes he’s playing well enough for one last push against Djokovic.  “I know it's not over yet. There's no point to start partying tonight or getting too emotional, too happy about it, even though I am extremely happy,” said Federer. “If it was the end of the tournament, it would be very different right now. I'd be speaking very different, feeling very different.  “There is, unfortunately or fortunately, one more match. It's great on many levels. But I’ve got to put my head down and stay focused.”",Novak Djokovic won Wimbledon in 2019.
Who won the US Open in 2019?,"Second-seeded Spaniard Rafael Nadal and fifth-seeded Russian Daniil Medvedev have been the most dominant players during the North American hard-court swing. They've also racked up more wins than any other players on Tour this year. Fittingly, they have set themselves for a championship clash at the US Open when they meet in Sunday’s final.  Their showdown in Arthur Ashe Stadium is a rematch of last month’s Coupe Rogers final, which saw Nadal drop just three games for his fifth title in Canada. Rather than intimidate the Russian, the experience facing Nadal has only energised him for his first Grand Slam final.  “Talking about Rafa, it's tough to find words,” Medvedev said. “He’s one of the greatest champions in the history of our sport. He's just a machine, a beast on the court. The energy he's showing is just amazing. To play him in your first Grand Slam final should be… an amazing thing to live.”  Many tennis fans cited Medvedev as the biggest chance outside the Big 3 to take the title, but the 23-year-old downplayed his chances and pointed out that he hadn’t reached a Grand Slam quarter-final. But in his match-by-match approach, Medvedev improved his record to 20-2 during the North American hard-court season by reaching the US Open final. Medvedev's magical run includes his first Masters 1000 title at the Western & Southern Open (d. Goffin), in addition to finishing runner-up in Montreal (l. to Nadal) and at the Citi Open (l. to Kyrgios). He is the only player on Tour to achieve 50 match victories this season. But there’s been little time for Medvedev to ponder his breakthrough because he’s been so busy winning. He seeks to cap off his summer stateside by becoming only the fifth player since 2009 to capture his maiden Grand Slam title. ”Of course, deep inside of me, I understand that what I've done these four weeks is amazing, even comparing to what I've done before,” Medvedev said. “I don't want to stop. I will always work to be better. I will try to do my best every day.”  Although Medvedev’s low-bouncing, off-speed shots have frustrated players throughout the year, they seemed to sit up in Nadal’s strike zone in Montreal. But while Nadal has gained plenty of free points on his serve this fortnight, the Russian’s return is one of his greatest strengths and he won’t allow the Spaniard as many free points.  The fifth seed will need to keep the points short and avoid engaging Nadal in prolonged baseline rallies. Medvedev will also need to play his lethal cross-court backhand into the Spaniard’s forehand. Although Nadal is stronger on that side, it will expose his backhand wing and give the Russian more opportunities to attack.  Nadal has been thriving in Arthur Ashe Stadium from the first ball this fortnight, feeding off the energy of the New York crowd and channeling it into his explosive baseline game. The Spaniard already arrived on a high after prevailing in Montreal, but he has looked nearly flawless in his quarter-final and semi-final victories over Diego Schwartzman and Matteo Berrettini. “I think at the beginning of my career have been some tough moments here, losing matches. But since a long time ago, every time that I came here I felt comfortable. I felt very competitive and fighting for the big things,” Nadal said. “I said every single day, but I can repeat: I feel comfortable here, I like the atmosphere, I like the crowd. I feel a big energy when I am playing in this Arthur Ashe Stadium.  “When I arrived here, my goal was to produce a chance to compete for the big thing again. Here I am.” Nadal will want to consider adding even more spin to his shots against Medvedev. Players who hit flat shots don’t like hitting balls above their shoulder, but the Russian has the advantage of being 6’6”. A high ball for most players falls into Medvedev’s strike zone, so the Spaniard will need to add further height in order to disrupt his opponent’s rhythm. It will also be crucial for Nadal to get off to a fast start. Once he’s come within a set of victory this fortnight, his opponents have appeared resigned to an inevitable defeat and the second seed sprinted to the finish line. Given the volume of matches that Medvedev has played recently, the prospect of rallying from two sets down may appear insurmountable.  After 18 years on tour, Nadal shows no signs of slowing down. He’s one match away from securing his fifth Grand Slam title in his 30s, a feat which would be unprecedented in the Open Era. A victory over Medvedev would also give Nadal his 19th Grand Slam title, putting him one shy of all-time leader Federer (20). But regardless of the end result on Sunday, Nadal said he will leave New York with his head high and proud of his efforts.  “Of course, I would love to be the one who wins the most Grand Slams, but I'll still sleep very well without being the one who has the most Grand Slams,” Nadal said. “I am happy about my career. I am very happy about what I'm doing. I'm going to keep working hard to try to produce chances. Sunday is just one more chance.  “You cannot be frustrated or thinking all day about what your neighbor has. You have to be happy with yourself. You have to do it your way.""",Rafael Nadal won the US Open in 2019.
Who won the Australian Open in 2018?,"Roger Federer and Marin Cilic were both in The Maldives on vacation at the end of November, following the 2017 ATP World Tour season.  “I didn't want to bother him. He didn't want to bother me,” Federer recalled following his semi-final on Friday. “After two days, he wrote me: ‘I'm here, too, in case you want to catch up and stuff, let me know’.” The pair practised twice for 45 minutes and even got together for drinks with their families.  “It's great fun. No coaches, no nothing, just the two of us on the court hitting balls,” Federer said. “It was just nice and laid back, to get to know the man behind the tennis player.”  Now the setting will be on Rod Laver Arena instead of a tropical island and the stakes will be infinitely higher, as the Swiss attempts to claim his 20th Grand Slam title and retain his Australian Open trophy against Cilic, who defeated Federer en route to his lone major triumph at the 2014 US Open. “It would be amazing,” said Federer, who can join Novak Djokovic and Roy Emerson as the only players to win six Australian Open titles. “I can't believe how fast now the week has turned out to be. Yeah, I mean, it ain't just an easy trip to the finals. There's always a lot of work that goes into it during the tournament.”  But with that being said, the World No. 2 has been impressive, advancing to the final without dropping a set. Federer can join Rafael Nadal and Bjorn Borg atop the record book by winning a Grand Slam without losing a set three times. The Swiss could become the first to do it in Melbourne. Cilic will be a tough test, though. The 29-year-old beat top-seeded Rafael Nadal in the quarter-finals one round after taking out No. 10 seed Pablo Carreno Busta in a three-hour, 27-minute battle. The right-hander can become the ninth man in the Open Era to oust the top two seeds at a Grand Slam if he defeats Federer. Only four have accomplished the feat at the Australian Open.  And if Cilic earns the title, becoming the first Croatian to do so, he will avenge a loss against Federer in the 2017 Wimbledon final. Cilic was once again in form, defeating four seeds en route to the final, but blisters hampered his chances against the now 19-time Grand Slam champion.    “I'm not looking at it as a revenge. I mean, it was on me that I couldn't give my best in Wimbledon. And that happens,” Cilic said. “But for me it's great to again be in the final, giving myself another opportunity to win a Grand Slam. I'm playing very good tennis, and definitely very excited for the rest of 2018.”  Cilic will have to continue playing at a high level to have a chance against Federer, who leads the pair’s FedEx ATP Head2Head series 8-1. A year ago, the Swiss took Melbourne by surprise when he won his first Slam since 2012 Wimbledon as the 17th seed after six months off due to injury. But this time Federer arguably entered the fortnight as the standalone favourite after winning an ATP World Tour-leading seven titles, including two majors (Australian Open, Wimbledon), in 2017.  “I just have to play a good match. At this point it's not about having to improve anything in particular,” Federer said. “I'm just pleased that actually my game has been good from the very beginning of the tournament so far. I mean, I've won all my matches without dropping a set. Clearly I was a bit lucky against [Tomas] Berdych in that first set [in the quarter-finals]. But things must be all right if I'm in this stage right now not having dropped a set and in the finals.” Federer also has the advantage of a lopsided FedEx ATP Head2Head series lead against Cilic. The 36-year-old, who is the fifth-oldest (36 years, 173 days) to advance to a Grand Slam final in the Open Era, has won their past three meetings, and three of four at the majors. But the Croatian believes that he has worked hard to set himself up in the match with a fighters’ chance.  “I think in tennis, in general, if you are not improving, you are getting worse as a player, because everyone else is improving... you have to always find a way to get better and better,” Cilic said. “I did good analysis I think of the last season. Found some things that can improve my game, some small details in the game that I focused on. It's working really nicely in the start of this year.”  Cilic will hope that it is enough to earn him a second Grand Slam title, as the pair competes for 2,000 ATP Rankings points and $4,000,000 in prize money. The runner-up will fly home with 1,200 points and $2,000,000.",Roger Federer won the Australian Open in 2018.
Who won Roland Garros in 2018?,"At some point, with so many mind-boggling stats and so much history having been accomplished, you almost just have to shake your head and shrug your shoulders at what Rafael Nadal has done at Roland Garros since 2005, when, as an enthusiastic 19-year-old, the Spaniard held his first Coupe des Mousquetaires. But wait, there's more, as there always is with Nadal, who is still improving at 32. When he meets Dominic Thiem – the only man to beat him on clay the past two seasons – in Sunday's Roland Garros final, Nadal will try to mark a few more historical boxes on his Hall of Fame application. The 10-time Roland Garros champion can become only the second player to win 11 singles titles at one Grand Slam. Margaret Court won 11 Australian women's singles titles before 1974. Nadal also will attempt to become the first player in the Open Era (since April 1968) to win 11 titles at three different tour-level events, having won his 11th titles at the Barcelona Open Banc Sabadell and Rolex Monte-Carlo Masters earlier this year. But Thiem, the 24-year-old Austrian making his Grand Slam final debut, should stride onto Court Philippe-Chatrier with his chest out and head nodding. The seventh seed beat Nadal last year in Rome and earlier this year in Madrid, accounting for 100 per cent of Nadal's two clay-court losses in 2017 and 2018 (49-2). Their Madrid quarter-final on 11 May was their ninth and most recent FedEx ATP Head2Head meeting (Nadal leads 6-3).  “On Sunday I have a very difficult match against a player that is playing great. I know I have to play my best if I want to have chances. Good thing is I played a lot of good matches this clay-court season,” Nadal said. “So Sunday is the day to give my best, is the day to increase even a little bit more the level.”  Thiem will try to become only the second Austrian player – man or woman – to win a Grand Slam title when he and Nadal, 2018's clay-court match-wins leaders, face off for the third time this year. Thiem's countryman Thomas Muster won the 1995 Roland Garros title.  “He's a role model for every Austrian tennis player. He's the biggest in our sport in Austria,” Thiem said. No man has won his maiden Grand Slam final since Marin Cilic at the 2014 US Open (d. Nishikori). Thiem (24 years, 3 days) can also become the youngest Grand Slam champion since Novak Djokovic (24 years, 252 days) at the 2012 Australian Open.  “I know how to play against him. I have a plan,” Thiem said of facing Nadal. “If I want to beat him, I have to play that way like I did in Rome and in Madrid. But I'm also aware that here it's tougher. He likes the conditions more here than in Madrid, for sure. Best of five is also different story.” Two of their nine FedEx ATP Head2Head matchups have come at Roland Garros, and Nadal has won both of them, including a straight-sets defeat during last year's semi-finals. The Spaniard will need to improve to 3-0 against Thiem at Roland Garros if he wants to stay No. 1 in the ATP Rankings. Lose, and Roger Federer will overtake the top spot. Thiem will rise to No. 7 regardless of Sunday's final, which the Austrian is trying to approach pressure-free and relaxed.  “Of course there is pressure, especially in Grand Slam finals, because I went a very long way now and I don't want to lose the finals,” Thiem said. “But on the other hand... I'm facing Rafa, I'm not the one who has the pressure.” Thiem, who beat second seed Alexander Zverev in the quarter-finals, could become just the ninth man in the Open Era to beat the top two seeds at a Grand Slam.",Rafael Nadal won Roland Garros in 2018.
Who won Wimbledon in 2018?,"Wait, there's still one more match to play?  Following two epic and exhilirating semi-finals, with both carrying the drama of a championship clash, one match remains to decide who reigns at Wimbledon in 2018.  It has been a fortnight to remember for Kevin Anderson and Novak Djokovic. Both competitors survived thrilling, extended semi-final encounters to reach the title match at the All England Club, with the South African edging John Isner 26-24 in the fifth set and the Serbian getting the better of longtime rival Rafael Nadal 10-8 in the decider. While three-time champion Djokovic added yet another moment to his growing list of achievements on the prestigious Centre Court lawn, Anderson earned his first taste of drama on the hallowed ground. Just two days earlier, the big-hitting 32-year-old had earned the respect of the Wimbledon faithful with a stunning comeback victory over Roger Federer. Then, on Friday, a record-breaking performance would ensue, as he captured the longest semi-final in tournament history, at six hours and 35 minutes.  And Djokovic would claim his own moment in the spotlight. For the first time in Wimbledon history, both semi-finals progressed past 6-all in the fifth set, as the Belgrade native needed five hours and 17 minutes - and two days - to dismiss Nadal.  Mental, emotional and physical fatigue will no doubt play a factor in Sunday's championship. But both players are well aware of what's at stake: One match for Wimbledon glory.  ""Kevin also had quite a few hours on the court in the last couple matches,"" Djokovic said on Saturday. ""But he had a day off, which is quite necessary at this stage. I wish I can have a day. But it is what it is. I'll just have to accept the circumstances and try to recover as best as I can.""  ""The legs are pretty jelly-like,"" Anderson assessed after Friday's win. ""Ideally I'd like to get out and hit for maybe 30 minutes [on Saturday], just to try to keep the same sort of routines that we've been having. But I've never played a match this long, so it will be something. We'll have to see how things go."" When Djokovic kicked off his comeback after undergoing a procedure on his right elbow in January, few could have foreseen such a dramatic turn in fortunes. The Serbian was struggling to find his form and rhythm, as a three-match losing streak saw him fall out of the Top 20 of the ATP Rankings.  But a mere four months later, Djokovic is back. After plotting his ascent with a semi-final run at the ATP World Tour Masters 1000 event in Rome, last eight finish at Roland Garros and runner-up result at Queen's Club, he removed all doubt with a dogged performance against Nadal to reach the Wimbledon final.  On Sunday, Djokovic will play for another slice of history as he attempts to become just the fourth player to lift the Wimbledon trophy on four or more occasions in the Open Era. Only Roger Federer (8), Pete Sampras (7) and Bjorn Borg (5) have enjoyed more success at SW19. The former World No. 1 is also targeting a 13th Grand Slam title overall, which would move him into solo fourth place on the all-time list.  Djokovic, who finds himself back on the Grand Slam final stage for the first time in nearly two years, is seeking his first trophy at any level since prevailing on the grass of Eastbourne in 2017.   The 31-year-old's recent reunion with longtime coach Marian Vajda is already paying dividends. After registering routine wins over Tennys Sandgren and Horacio Zeballos to open the fortnight, he recorded impressive four-set victories over home hope Kyle Edmund and a surging Kei Nishikori, in addition to a three-set triumph over Karen Khachanov.  But on Sunday, Djokovic will face an equally in-form Anderson. Despite owning a 5-1 lead in their FedEx ATP Head2Head series, he knows that the South African is playing the best tennis of his career. ""Considering he's playing only his second Grand Slam final, obviously he has a lot more to gain,"" said Djokovic. ""If I take my last couple years, I don't have much to lose myself. I'm again in a Grand Slam final after a long time, after actually almost two years. Of course, we want this trophy. We want this match, both of us. Who is going to take it? I don't know. It really depends.  ""I don't know if I'll be the clear favourite in that one. I think we're quite even. He's definitely playing the tennis of his life. He's coming off from two epic marathon five-set wins. I don't think he has much to lose really tomorrow. He's going to come out with big serves and big tennis. Hopefully I'll be able to weather the storm.""  This is the first time in the Open Era that the Wimbledon men’s singles final will be contested by a pair of players aged 30 or over. Anderson has not defeated Djokovic since claiming their first meeting at the 2008 Miami Open presented by Itau. The Serbian has since prevailed on hard, clay and grass, including a pair of wins at the All England Club. He earned a straight-set win in the second round in 2011, before storming back from two sets down to prevail in the Round of 16 in 2015. Djokovic will break back into the Top 10 of the ATP Rankings with a victory on Sunday, while Anderson is bidding to ascend to a career-high No. 4 with his maiden Grand Slam crown. The Johannesburg native is already ensured of cracking the Top 5 for the first time in his career. Runner-up at last year's US Open (l. to Nadal), Anderson's quest for a first major title also carries an element of national significance. The South African would become the first man from his country to win the Wimbledon title. He is also vying to become the second from the African continent to do so, along with Egyptian Jaroslav Drobny (1954).  In addition, 32-year-old Anderson is bidding to become the second-oldest first-time Grand Slam champion, behind only Andres Gimeno, who was 34 years old when he won at Roland Garros in 1972. Records aside, Anderson will be buoyed by a string of impressive performances in 2018. He lifted his fourth ATP World Tour trophy at the inaugural New York Open, before reaching a 500-level final on the hard courts of Acapulco. Quarter-final results at the March Masters events of Indian Wells and Miami would follow, as well as a first ATP World Tour Masters 1000 semi-final on the clay of Madrid. He is bidding to become the fifth player to reach 30 tour-level match wins in 2018, joining Nadal, Dominic Thiem, Alexander Zverev and Juan Martin del Potro.   After surviving a pair of extended five-set marathons, what will Anderson and Djokovic provide for an encore in Sunday's championship? If it's anything like their semi-final performances, it should be a another pulsating affair on the Centre Court grass.",Novak Djokovic won Wimbledon in 2018.
Who won the US Open in 2018?,"Three years ago, Juan Martin del Potro felt the wheels were spinning as he struggled to gain any traction. His problematic wrists had again flared up and despite the very best in medical attention and rehabilitation, doubts about whether it was all worth it plagued his mind more heavily than any time previously.  If the Argentine had known he would contest a Grand Slam final again in 2018, any shred of uncertainty would have vanished. But such a prediction would have been outlandish to even Del Potro’s most loyal supporters.  There was nothing to suggest he would ever compete again, let alone at the highest level. On Sunday, the 29-year-old will get that shot at a second Grand Slam title, nine years after he stunned Rafael Nadal and Roger Federer back-to-back to win the US Open. “The worst moment was in 2015 when I was close to quitting this sport because I couldn't find a way to fix my wrist problems,” Del Potro said. “I had been suffering a lot. I got depressed for a couple of months also. I didn't get the chance to feel better with myself, to do this again. That was the bad moment for me.  “But I think that is completely in the past, and now I'm… looking forward for the future. I didn't expect to get these kinds of emotions playing tennis again. Reaching finals, winning titles, having my highest ranking ever in this moment, everything is almost perfect.”  Novak Djokovic’s stint out of the game and struggles to rediscover his best level pale in comparison to the length and frequency of setbacks Del Potro has endured. But the Serbian, too, has been enjoying a resurgence in 2018.  He entered this year’s Australian Open as the No. 14 seed and was soundly beaten by inaugural Next Gen ATP Finals champion Hyeon Chung in the fourth round. Less than eight months on, he will attempt to win two straight Grand Slam titles for the first time since he completed the Career Grand Slam in Paris in 2016. ""I personally like [Del Potro] very much, not just as a player but as a person. He is a dear friend, someone that I respect a lot,"" said Djokovic. ""We all felt for his struggles with injuries that kept him away from the Tour for two, three years.  ""But he was always a Top 5 player in the eyes, I think, of everyone. Even when he dropped his ranking and started to work his way up, we all knew that he has a capacity and a quality to get to the point where he is at the moment. It was just a matter of time... He's a big-match player. He's a Grand Slam winner. He's playing the tennis of his life, without a doubt, in the past 15 months."" Del Potro has conceded just one set at this year’s US Open – to John Isner in the quarter-finals – and that could prove telling if he was to deny one of the sport’s fittest and best movers. The No. 3 seed led top seed and defending champion Rafael Nadal two sets to love before the Spaniard retired with a right knee complaint in the semi-finals.  Djokovic, too, has enjoyed a smooth path to Sunday’s final. The No. 6 seed dropped sets in his opening two rounds but has not dropped more than four games in a set in his subsequent four matches.  He extended his FedEx ATP Head2Head record against Japan’s Kei Nishikori to 15-2 in Friday’s second semi-final. He holds a similarly imposing 14-4 record against Del Potro.  ""I've played him many times on different occasions,"" said Djokovic. ""We've never faced each other in a Grand Slam final, so that's something new... One of the keys of the match will be return, how well can I return, how many returns I can get back in play, but [I will] also try to have some depth in that return, and how accurately I can serve myself. I think that's very important. When you play a big server like del Potro, you feel pressure also on your service games.""  But the Argentine knows he has what it takes to beat the Serbian on the biggest stages. Twice in Olympic competition Del Potro denied Djokovic – for a bronze medal in London, in 2012, and in the first round in 2016, in Rio de Janeiro.  “Well, it will be a difficult match because we are close friends,” Del Potro said. “For sure we both want to win. But Novak has won Wimbledon already. He's playing so good. He will be the favourite to win on Sunday.   “But I don't know. When I played Roger nine years ago, he was the favourite to win, as well. I will try to make the surprise again.”  As an added bonus, Del Potro will clinch his place at the Nitto ATP Finals if he wins Sunday's final. Djokovic will contest his 23rd Grand Slam final, the third most in men's tennis history.",Novak Djokovic won the US Open in 2018.
Who won the Australian Open in 2017?,"Feeling nostalgic? You're not alone. Less than 24 hours remain until Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal turn back the clock on Rod Laver Arena for the Australian Open championship, a record ninth clash in a Grand Slam final. Nadal sought to describe his emotions ahead of the renewal of one of the greatest rivalries of all-time.  “[Our rivalry] is amazing for me and for tennis,” said Nadal. “It is the combination of two different styles that makes the matches really special. It is a different way to play tennis. I feel that this rivalry is not only in the tennis world. People from outside of our world talk about this and that's good for our sport. It is good that we are back here.  “It is special to play with Roger again in the final of a Grand Slam. I cannot lie. It is great. It is exciting for me and for both of us that we are still here and still fighting for important events. So that's important for us. That's very special.” ""Having matched up for many years, they're older now, but still playing just great tennis,"" said Aussie great Rod Laver. ""They know each other's game. Roger has improved his backhand and that would take away the advantage Nadal has with his forehand.""   Federer and Nadal both survived five-set semi-final thrillers, with the Swiss overcoming countryman Stan Wawrinka and the Spaniard denying a resurgent Grigor Dimitrov. It will be their second encounter in the final Down Under, following a four-hour and 23-minute epic in 2009, which saw Nadal prevail 7-5, 3-6, 7-6(3), 3-6, 6-2. On Sunday, plenty will be at stake:  A win for Federer would see the No. 17 seed lift an unprecedented 18th major trophy and return to the Top 10 of the Emirates ATP Rankings. He is looking to become the first player in history to win five or more titles at three different Grand Slam events and take sole ownership of third place on the Australian Open titles list. A win for Nadal would see the ninth seed close the gap on Federer with his 15th major title, moving past Pete Sampras into solo second place on the all-time list. More impressively, he would become the first man in the Open Era – and third in history (Emerson, Laver) – to win each of the four majors multiple times. Meeting for the first time since October 2015 at the Swiss Indoors Basel, Nadal owns a 23-11 FedEx ATP Head2Head edge and is 14-7 in tour-level finals. Federer, however, has won three of their five hard-court title matches and enters as a four-time champion at Melbourne Park. But the numbers don’t tell the entire story.  With 35 titanic clashes over the last 13 years, Federer and Nadal have staked their claim as the greatest rivalry in sporting history. In tennis, time is a commodity. Careers don't last forever. It's not the longest-running rivalry of all-time, but it is arguably the most pervasive, transcending Federer and Nadal themselves and becoming a staple of modern culture.  From Lionel Messi-Cristiano Ronaldo in football to Muhammad Ali-Joe Frazier in boxing, Jack Nicklaus-Arnold Palmer in golf and Larry Bird-Magic Johnson in the NBA, there have been many legendary rivalries over the years, but few have captured the imagination quite like Roger vs. Rafa. They have made each other stronger, more influential figures both between the lines and away from the court. ""I just think he's an incredible tennis player,"" said Federer. ""He's got shots that no one has. When you have that, you are unique and special. Plus, he's got the grit. He's got the mental and physical ability to sustain a super high level of play for years and for hours and for weeks.  ""He's proven that time and time again. He's come back from many injuries, you know, time and time again. He made it seem easy, and it's not. I think he's been tremendous for the game. I have a lot of respect for him on many levels."" Effusive in their praise of one another, Federer and Nadal have established a special bond. During the offseason, as the Swiss was continuing to plot his comeback following a knee injury, he took time out to visit his rival’s hometown of Manacor for the launch of the Rafa Nadal Academy. As the tides begin to turn on the ATP World Tour, with a fresh crop of young talent and surging #NextGenATP stars fighting their way to the forefront, the days of Federer and Nadal ruling the tennis universe had been pushed aside, but they are legends of the game for a reason. Despite enduring their share of injuries and ailments in 2016, the Swiss and the Spaniard have immediately reclaimed their moments in the spotlight, proving that the old guard is here to stay.",Roger Federer won the Australian Open in 2017.
Who won Roland Garros in 2017?,"Another gripping fortnight on the terre battue of Roland Garros is nearly in the books, with two former titlists set to square off for the Coupe des Mousquetaires. There have been no shortage of storylines throughout the first 14 days of the tournament and the same can be said for Sunday's championship between third seed Stan Wawrinka and fourth seed Rafael Nadal.  Nadal has been careening towards a date with destiny, marching into a 10th final in the French capital without dropping a set. As ruthless as the Spaniard had been in streaking to the titles in Monte-Carlo, Barcelona and Madrid, he has been arguably even more impressive at Roland Garros, relinquishing just 29 games - an average of just five games lost in six matches. It is the second-fewest number of games dropped in reaching a Grand Slam final in the Open Era, behind only Bjorn Borg's run to the 1978 Roland Garros final.  Nadal secured his place in his 22nd major final (14-7 record) with a convincing 6-3, 6-4, 6-0 victory over an in-form Dominic Thiem in Friday's semi-finals. Now on the precipice of a historic, extraordinary achievement, the King of Clay is just one win from etching his name in the Grand Slam history books. He is bidding to not only become the first player in the Open Era to lift 10 trophies at a single tournament, but also become the oldest in history to claim his 15th major title. The Manacor native would pass Pete Sampras for solo second on the all-time list.  With his quest to complete 'La Decima' hanging in the balance, Nadal will face a formidable and familiar opponent in Sunday's final. Two of the game's deadliest, most feared weapons will be on display as Nadal's heavy topspin forehand clashes with Wawrinka's majestic, mammoth backhand. Both competitors will look to generate great depth on their preferred wings, taking time away from their opponent and opening the court for finishing blows. Firepower meets firepower on Court Philippe Chatrier, with No. 2 in the Emirates ATP Rankings on the line. ""For me, being in the final is always a very positive result,"" said Nadal. ""Now remains one match against a very tough opponent, so he will be full of confidence for Sunday. And he's a very dangerous player because he can hit the ball very hard. I need to play aggressive, I need to play long, I need to try to not let him play from easy positions. If not, I'm going to be in big trouble.  ""It's true that when he hits hard, he hits really hard. Stopping him can be difficult... I will have to do everything I can to keep him from playing aggressively. If I can play long balls, if I can hit hard, if I can do that, I think I will be able to control him. I know he's dangerous when he plays aggressively, so I need to limit his possibilities.""  Nadal leads the FedEx ATP Head2Head 15-3, but Wawrinka has history on his side as well. The 2015 champion will look to extend his perfect mark in Grand Slam finals, entering his second Roland Garros title match with a 3-0 record.  ""To play Rafa on clay in the final of the French Open is probably the biggest challenge you can have in tennis,"" said Wawrinka. ""He's the best player ever on clay. He's going for his 10th Roland Garros, so it's something really impressive, something tough."" One of the biggest clutch performers in today's game, the Swiss is also no stranger to denying dates with destiny. In the 2014 Australian Open final, he stopped Nadal's quest to become the first player in the Open Era to win all four majors twice. One year later, he momentarily halted Novak Djokovic's bid to complete the career Grand Slam at Roland Garros with a near-flawless performance in the final.  The 32-year-old Swiss is looking to write his name in the history books as well, seeking to join elite company as just the third player to win three or more Grand Slam titles after turning 30. Only Rod Laver and Ken Rosewall have done so. A win would also secure him a career-high  No. 2 in the Emirates ATP Rankings, becoming the oldest to make his Top 2 debut in more than 40 years.  Wawrinka enters the final after surviving a grueling five-set battle against top seed Andy Murray on Friday. He notched his fourth win over a World No. 1 after nearly five hours, rallying from two-sets-to-one down to extend his win streak to 10 straight. The champion on home soil in Geneva two weeks ago, the Lausanne native is vying for his fifth straight win in a clay-court final. ""It's going to be really difficult,"" Wawrinka added. ""But again, in the end of the day, it's the final. The pressure is on both players. No one goes on the court thinking he has no pressure. We both want to win the title and we are both going to give it our all on the court.  ""He's for sure going to be the favourite with what he's done in the past, but also this season already he's playing so well. So I will have for sure to play my best tennis. But again, I did that in the past, so we will see what's going to happen on Sunday.""",Rafael Nadal won Roland Garros in 2017.
Who won Wimbledon in 2017?,"When the 2017 season began, few would have foreseen Roger Federer standing on the doorstep of a second Grand Slam crown and tour-leading fifth title of the year. As Federer continues to etch his name in the history books, the Swiss isn’t just sending a loud and resounding message to the rest of the ATP World Tour, but making the case for one of the greatest seasons of all time.  On Sunday, Federer will look to solidify his standing as the most successful man to ever grace the lawns of the All England Club, when he bids for a record eighth title at The Championships. He carries a 30-2 win-loss mark in 2017 into the final, which will be a record-tying 102nd Wimbledon match (w/Jimmy Connors). Having not dropped a set all fortnight, the 35 year old is not merely turning back the clock with his ruthless run to the final, but proving that he is more dominant than ever. Employing the same aggressive and authoritative gameplan that saw him lift his 18th major trophy at the Australian Open, seal the Sunshine Double in Indian Wells and Miami, and notch a staggering ninth Gerry Weber Open title, Federer enters the final having dropped just four service games. But another triumph at SW19 won’t be a simple task for the Swiss maestro, with Marin Cilic the last remaining obstacle to Wimbledon immortality.  ""I don't want to say it's more relaxed going into it because I have a good head-to-head record against Marin, even though the matches were extremely close,"" Federer said. ""But it's not like we've played against each other 30 times."" Cilic is surging under the tutelage of Jonas Bjorkman, having reached the semi-finals in ‘s-Hertogenbosch and finished runner-up at Queen’s Club, before storming through a difficult draw for his second Grand Slam final berth. Despite trailing their FedEx ATP Head2Head 6-1, the Croatian will take confidence, knowing he has the blueprint to pull the upset. Cilic routed Federer in the semis of the 2014 US Open, en route to his lone Grand Slam title, and pushed the Swiss to five sets in last year’s Wimbledon quarter-finals.  ""But I still know that it's a big mountain to climb,” said Cilic. “Roger is playing maybe some of his best tennis of his career at the moment, having a great season. So I know it's going to be a huge challenge. But I believe I'm ready."" The 28 year old is vying to become just the second Croatian player to win the Wimbledon title, joining Goran Ivanisevic (2001), while bidding to become the sixth active player to stake claim to multiple Grand Slam crowns. He would join Stan Wawrinka and the Big Four of Federer, Novak Djokovic, Rafael Nadal and Andy Murray in the exclusive club. Moreover, victory for Cilic would break the stranglehold of the Big Four on the Wimbledon title, becoming the first player outside the quartet to win the title since Lleyton Hewitt in 2002.  ""I would say that I'm now in a little bit of a better form, maybe just slightly mentally stronger, maybe learned a few more lessons, valuable lessons,"" said Cilic, also reflecting on his win in New York. ""But still it's a final. It's never easy to deal with it. You never know how your emotions are going to be when you enter that Centre Court.  ""I'm believing that I have the ability and that I have a good game and I played really well during the tournament. That is obviously very important in giving me a lot of confidence to prepare for this final.""  ""I thought he played very well,"" Federer added, referring to Cilic's victory at the US Open three years ago. ""The conditions were fast. He was clocking returns and serves at will. He was doing a great job. I think I had a minor chance at one point maybe in the third set. Just the way he was playing, he was confident and feeling it and seeing it. It was very impressive.” Emirates ATP Rankings implications abound on Sunday, with Federer poised to rise to No. 3 with the title – his first Top 3 standing in nearly a year. Cilic, meanwhile, is hoping to move to a career-high World No. 5 with a win. He would become the first Croatian to feature in the Top 5 since Ivan Ljubicic in 2007.  One of the biggest factors that could play a significant role on Sunday is physical stamina. While both players take pride in their conditioning, Federer has spent just under 10 hours on court (9:56) during the fortnight, while Cilic has needed an additional four and a half hours (14:28) to reach his first Wimbledon final. Should the Basel native continue the trend and win in straight sets, he will become just the second player in the Open Era to win the grass-court crown without dropping a set, joining Bjorn Borg (1976). Federer has won a major crown without relinquishing a set only once, at the 2007 Australian Open.  ""Of course I'm going to try to play within myself,"" Federer continued. ""I have to play offensive. If you give Marin now time on the ball, he can finish points nicely. The court is still playing quite fast. It helps on my serve, but it also helps him. I'm sure it's going to be a close match.""",Roger Federer won Wimbledon in 2017.
Who won the US Open in 2017?,"The US Open championship on Sunday at Arthur Ashe Stadium matches World No. 1 Rafael Nadal against No. 28 seed Kevin Anderson, who is making his Grand Slam final debut. Nadal has won the four previous meetings (9-1 in sets), including a third round match in Barcelona in April. In their lone Grand Slam meeting, Nadal won 75 61 64 in the Round of 16 at the 2015 Australian Open.  The champion will be the fifth straight Grand Slam winner 30 & over going back to last year’s US Open where Stan Wawrinka (31) captured the title. Since then, Roger Federer (35) won the Australian Open and Wimbledon, and Nadal (31) earned the Roland Garros crown. This is just the seventh time in the Open Era that a Grand Slam final has been contested by a pair of players 30 & over. This is the first 30 & over US Open final since 2002 when Pete Sampras (31) defeated Andre Agassi (32). The Big Four of Nadal, Federer, Novak Djokovic and Andy Murray has won 45 of the last 50 Grand Slam titles. Anderson is trying to become only the fourth player to break through and join former US Open champions Juan Martin del Potro, Marin Cilic and Wawrinka during that stretch, Wawrinka has won three Grand Slam titles. Since 2005 Roland Garros, Nadal and Federer have both captured 15 Grand Slam titles (Djokovic-12, Murray-3). Nadal is appearing in his fourth US Open final (2-1), the first since capturing the 2013 title. His three previous US Open finals came against Novak Djokovic, beating the Serb in 2010 and falling in the 2011 title match. Nadal is making his third Grand Slam final showing of the season with a runner-up at the Australian Open (l. to Federer) and capturing a 10th Roland Garros crown (d. Wawrinka). The 31-year-old Spaniard is 15-7 lifetime in Grand Slam finals. His last Slam title on hard courts came here in Flushing Meadows in 2013. Nadal is attempting to win at least two Grand Slam titles in a season for the fourth time in his career (3 in 2010, 2 in 2008, 2013). He is trying to win his first hard court singles title since January 2014 in Doha (d. Monfils). He has played 34 hard-court tournaments, reaching eight hard-court finals since his last title on the surface. Nadal has not faced a Top 20 opponent at the US Open and the last Grand Slam champion to do that was Pete Sampras at 2000 Wimbledon. Anderson is the first South African to reach the US Open final since Cliff Drysdale (l. to Santana) in 1965 and in a Grand Slam final since Kevin Curren (l. to Wilander) at the 1984 Australian Open. Johan Kriek is the last South African Grand Slam singles champion at the 1981 Australian Open (d. Denton). Kriek represented the USA when he won the 1982 Australian Open. The 31-year-old Anderson is the oldest first-time Grand Slam finalist since Nikki Pilic (33) at 1973 Roland Garros (l. to Nastase).  The oldest first-time Slam champion in the Open Era is Andres Gimeno (34) at 1972 Roland Garros. The World No. 32 Anderson is the lowest-ranked Grand Slam finalist since No. 38 Jo-Wilfried Tsonga at the 2008 Australian Open (l. to Djokovic). Anderson is also the lowest-ranked US Open finalist since the inception of the Emirates ATP Rankings in 1973. The previous lowest-ranked US Open finalist was No. 22 Mark Philippoussis  in 1998 (l. to Rafter). No. 20-ranked Andre Agassi is the lowest-ranked US Open champion in 1994. Anderson is trying to become the lowest-ranked Grand Slam champion since No. 44 Gaston Gaudio at 2004 Roland Garros.",Rafael Nadal won the US Open in 2017.
Who won the Australian Open in 2016?,"Prior to one of the 30 matches Andy Murray and Novak Djokovic have played over the past decade, a reporter asked Murray, “Is this a rivalry wrapped up in a friendship or just a rivalry wrapped up in an intense rivalry?”  The question, though perhaps a bit too Churchillian for your everyday tennis pro, was a valid one. The Scotsman and Serb had practically grown up together, after all. Born within a week of each other in May 1987, they met when they were just 12 and came up through the junior ranks together. They’ve practised together. They’ve played doubles together. They’ve played the occasional game of pick-up basketball. Now 28, both married and Murray poised to join his counterpart in fatherhood, they insist they’re good friends to this day.  But one naturally must wonder if the lopsided FedEx ATP Head2Head, tilted in Djokovic’s favour at 21-9, has taken a toll on the relationship.  “We've played a lot in the last couple of years,” said Murray, who on Sunday will face Djokovic in a rematch of the 2015 final, the fourth time they will have played for the Australian Open crown in the past six years. “Last year here is a good match for me to look at because the tennis, in my opinion, wasn't miles apart. It was a very close match for three sets [7-6(5), 6-7(4), 6-3, 6-0]. Same thing in Miami when we played there [7-6(3), 4-6, 6-0]. A couple sets were very tight. French Open was close, as well [6-3, 6-3, 5-7, 5-7, 6-1]. I managed to get the win in Canada in another very close match [6-4, 4-6, 6-3]. The most important thing for me is to sustain my level for long enough, not just for one set here or there, a few games here or there. I need to do it for a very long period if I want to get the win. That's my challenge on Sunday.”  “It's always a special kind of challenge because we have the rivalry that goes back for a long time,” said Djokovic, who has reached more Aussie Open finals (six) than any other player in the Open Era. “It's always very physical, also very psychologically demanding. We push each other to the limit.”  On Sunday, they will contest their fourth Australian Open final against each other, Djokovic having prevailed on each previous occasion. The World No. 1 has won 10 of his past 11 matches against Murray, and he’s 6-2 against the Scot at the Grand Slams, 3-2 in major finals. The only player Djokovic has beaten on more occasions than Murray at the Slams is Roger Federer (nine times).  There’s no denying that Djokovic has played somewhat unevenly at times this year in Melbourne. His 100-error outing against Gilles Simon resulted in a narrow five-set 6-3, 6-7(1), 6-4, 4-6, 6-3 escape in the fourth round. But if Djokovic can pull off second-week wins at the Slams even when he’s not playing his best ball, what kind of message does that send to his opponents?  Even Simon was taken aback after his near-upset of the 10-time Slam champ. Said the Frenchman, “He's improving year after year. That's terrible to say because he's already No. 1.”  “It's not a very pleasant feeling when you're not playing well,” noted Djokovic, who is coming off one of the most dominant season in tennis history, one on which he went 82-6 and won three of the four majors. “But certainly it's a good feeling when you win not playing well.”  He certainly rediscovered his form in the semi-finals against the No. 3-seeded Federer, defeating his longtime rival 6-1, 6-2, 3-6, 6-3 and going as far as to say he thought the first two sets were the best he'd ever played against the Swiss legend. And that's saying something, considering they have now met 45 times.   Murray, meanwhile, is looking to become the first man in the Open Era to win the Australian Open title after losing four finals. (He finished as runner-up to Federer in 2010, and to Djokovic in 2011, 2013 and 2015.) At the same time, he’s looking to avoid becoming only the second man in the Open Era to lose five Grand Slam finals at any one major. His former coach Ivan Lendl is, for the moment, the lone man on that list, having come up empty at the US Open from 1982-84 and 1988-89 (the Czech-American did win three straight between 1985 and 1987).  But if you’re looking for the father-to-be to come in as defeatist, you’ll be disappointed. Murray has long underlined the pride has had in his achievements in Melbourne Park, though they have yet to result in the trophy, aka the Norman Brookes Challenge Cup.  “Five finals is a great achievement. You can't take that away from me,” he said. “I should be happy about that. There's very few players that will have made five Australian Open finals, so I have to be proud of that achievement. Obviously, when you get to the final, you're disappointed if you don't win. But I've played very good tennis here. I've given myself many opportunities to reach the finals. Seven straight quarter-finals, as well. I have a very good shot on Sunday if I play my best tennis. I need to do it for long enough to have a chance. I'm aware of that. I don't think many people are expecting me to win. I have to just believe in myself, have a solid game plan, and hopefully execute it. Doesn't matter what's happened in the past, really. It's about what happens on Sunday. There's no reason it's not possible for me to win.”  The good news for Murray? In five of the past eight years, the man who played his semi-final second, as he did, has gone on to win the final. But the two-time Slam champ (US Open 2012, Wimbledon 2013) will likely rely more on his always-improving arsenal than some statistical fortuity.  In many ways his game and that of his oft-opponent Djokovic aren’t far apart: elite return game, exacting fitness regimen, punishing ground-strokes, plenty of heart. This one might just come down to who can out-think the other.",Novak Djokovic won the Australian Open in 2016.
Who won Roland Garros in 2016?,"Top seed Novak Djokovic and second seed Andy Murray square off for the 34th time on tour in Sunday’s Roland Garros final, but this match arguably has the biggest implications out of all their meetings.  Djokovic is aiming to complete the career Grand Slam, becoming just the eighth man – and the fourth in the Open era – to accomplish that feat. A win on Sunday would also make him just the third man to hold all four majors at once (joining Rod Laver and Don Budge). Meanwhile, Murray is looking to become the first British winner at Roland Garros since Fred Perry in 1935.  ""It's obviously a very big match for both of us. Neither of us know how many more chances we'll have to win here,"" said Murray. ""We have had some really big battles in the Slams on all the other surfaces. I'm sure it will be the same again on Sunday.""  Their paths to the final couldn’t be more different. Besides an opening-set blip in his fourth-round against No. 14 seed Roberto Bautista Agut, Djokovic hasn’t dropped a set and recorded dominant scorelines in several matches. Murray had to rally from two sets down to survive his opening round against qualifier Radek Stepanek, then found himself a set away from defeat again in the second round against French wild card Mathias Bourgue. Although he’s rounded into top form as the tournament has progressed, he still had to withstand stern tests from No. 9 seed Richard Gasquet in the quarter-finals and No. 3 seed Stan Wawrinka in the semi-finals.  The World No. 1 also has more experience in Grand Slam finals, heading into his 20th major final compared to 10 for Murray. Djokovic will make his fourth appearance in the Roland Garros final (having lost in 2012, 2014 and 2015), while Murray hadn’t made a final in Paris prior to this year.  Djokovic leads their FedEx ATP Head2Head rivalry 23-10 and has won 12 of their last 14 matches. He holds a 7-2 record over Murray in Grand Slams, including a 4-2 record in Grand Slam finals. However, both of Murray’s Grand Slam wins came over Djokovic in the championship match. Their only career meeting at Roland Garros came last year, when the Serbian prevailed in a five-set semi-final.   Murray’s clay-court game has reached new levels in the last two years, though. The Brit entered the 2015 season with a 63-37 record on clay and no finals appearances. Since then, he has posted a 35-3 record and won three titles. He took Djokovic to three sets before losing their championship match last month at the ATP World Tour Masters 1000 Series event in Madrid, then avenged the loss on his birthday a week later with his first clay court victory over the Serbian in the Rome final.  ""He's one of the most dedicated tennis players on tour. He always seeks to improve his game and get better,"" said Djokovic. ""It's pretty nice that our rivalry has evolved over the years.""  Having played their first match against each other when they were both 11 years old, the pair will know exactly what to expect when they take the court on Sunday. With little separating them in current form, the result may come down to who handles the occasion better.",Novak Djokovic won Roland Garros in 2016.
Who won Wimbledon in 2016?,"Andy Murray is only too familiar with the position Milos Raonic finds himself in on Sunday in the championships match at Wimbledon.  Until he lifted the 2012 US Open trophy, Murray had long borne the expectation of a nation desperate for Grand Slam glory. The Scot has since become one of Britain’s greatest ever sportsmen and will play for his second Wimbledon crown and third major trophy on Sunday.  Raonic, meanwhile, is looking to make history for his country as the first Canadian man to win a Grand Slam singles title.  While the 25-year-old Raonic is playing his first Grand Slam final – after overcoming seven-time Wimbledon champion Roger Federer in the semi-finals – Murray will play his 11th major title match and hopes that his experience could prove pivotal.  “I hope that's an advantage,” said Murray, who became the first British male in 77 years to triumph at Wimbledon when he beat Djokovic in the 2013 final.  “When I played my first one (at the 2008 US Open), it all came round really quickly for me. I played the semi-final over two days against Rafa, then went straight into the final the following day. It just didn't feel like there was loads of time to sort of settle down and sort of prepare for it. I remember it went by fairly quickly.  “I didn't feel so nervous before that one maybe because there wasn't as much time to get ready for it. But playing a slam final obviously is different. There's a little bit more riding on the match. That's what makes these events special.”  Murray has a 2-8 record in major finals, losing his past three efforts at the Australian Open and Roland Garros this year and at the Australian Open in 2015. All three of those losses came at the hands of World No. 1 Novak Djokovic, who suffered a shock third-round defeat to Sam Querrey at Wimbledon.  Indeed, it will be the first time that Murray will compete in a Grand Slam final against someone other than Djokovic or Federer. “That's different,” said Murray. “But you never know how anyone's going to deal with the pressures of a slam final. So just have to go out there and concentrate on my side, do what I can to prepare well for it and see what happens.”  The match will be a repeat of the Aegon Championships final, which saw Raonic let slip a set and a break lead before succumbing to Murray. Murray, now on an 11-match winning streak going into the Wimbledon final, leads their FedEx ATP Head2Head 6-3, winning his past five clashes with the Canadian.  Reflecting on their final at The Queen’s Club, Murray said, “It helps to have played a match against him on the grass and see some of the things he's doing on this surface a little bit differently. “The thing that stands out for me was the return winner I hit on the break point at 3-1 to get back into the match. That was the turning point really. He hadn't lost serve the whole week. Came up with that return, the match changed from there. Obviously Milos has got a fantastic serve. So returning his serve is important.  “Milos is a very tough opponent,” continued the Scot. “He's played very well on the grass this year and has earned his right to the final by beating one of the best, if not the best player, ever at this event. So he deserves to be there.”  History is on the line for Raonic when he steps onto Centre Court at 2pm on Sunday. The Toronto native is looking to become the fourth man in the Open Era to win his first grass-court title at Wimbledon, joining Djokovic (2011), Andre Agassi (1992) and Michael Stich (1991). He would also become the first player outside of the ‘Big Four’ to win the Wimbledon title since Lleyton Hewitt triumphed in 2002.  The right-hander, who added John McEnroe to his coaching team for the grass-court season, battled his way through to his first major final after rallying from a two-sets-to-one deficit against Federer, defeating a Top 10 player on grass for the first time. The Canadian had also recovered from a two-set deficit against David Goffin in the fourth round. “It's a pretty special feeling for myself,” said Raonic. “But I think it's a pretty special recognition to the state of Canadian tennis. It's great to sort of be at the front and centre of that come Sunday. I'm glad that I've sort of been leading this charge, the first one to break through and really put these things together.  “But I'm by no means done.  “I felt I was doing a lot of things well [coming into Wimbledon]. I was putting the pieces together. I was just hoping they would make some good music for me at that point. It's come together nicely.  There's obviously been bumps throughout this week. I've overcome a lot of different things. Those things have made me stronger. Now I have an even bigger tool set to face that challenge on Sunday than I did a few Sundays ago [against Murray].”  Indeed, Raonic is not content to make up the numbers in the final. The Canadian is adamant he came to the All England Club with one goal – to win the tournament. It is a mentality that has been pivotal in taking him to the final, believes his coach, Carlos Moya.  ""[Milos' mentality] has been the most important thing. To get to the final of a slam you have to come through very difficult situations, like he was in against Goffin and yesterday. He kept fighting and mentally he has been very strong. We are putting a lot of work into that. Tennis-wise we know what his weapons are and how well he's playing, but mentally he kept fighting a lot and it's paying off.  ""Tomorrow he can't slow down, not even a bit, mentally. We know how tough Andy is and what a good fighter he is. Milos has the weapons to hurt Andy, like we saw at Queen's. It's about being aggressive, serving well and he will have his chances. He's ready for it."" Speaking about the effect former World No. 1 Moya has had on his game, Raonic said, “He's been a great influence. He's helped me a lot with understanding how I need to go about things, what I need to get out of myself, whether that be through trial and error or through discussion.  “Obviously that's been my biggest asset through this tournament and through the Queen's tournament, especially after I finished off in Paris a bit disappointed. It's been a great asset for me. It's what's helped me be as successful as I have over the past few weeks. It's definitely the biggest step forward I've made.”",Andy Murray won Wimbledon in 2016.
Who won the US Open in 2015?,"The Top 2 players in the Emirates ATP Rankings, Novak Djokovic and Roger Federer, meet for the 42nd time Sunday in what has become the most riveting rivalry in all of tennis. Each man enters the final in fantastic form – Djokovic posting a record-setting rout of defending champion Marin Cilic on Friday and Federer sweeping 28 straight sets since losing to Djokovic in the Wimbledon final. The champion receives 2,000 ranking points and $3,300,000. The runner-up receives 1,200 ranking points and $1,600,000.  US Open Final Record: Djokovic is 1-4 and Federer is 5-1 in US Open finals. The Swiss superstar returns to the final for the first time since winning five straight in 2004-08 and falling to Juan Martin del Potro in 2009.  Djokovic's Historic Season: By beating Cilic, Djokovic joined Federer and Rod Laver as just third player in the Open Era to reach all four Grand Slam finals in a single season. He has advanced to 16 of the last 21 Grand Slam finals overall. Federer reached 18 of 19 from 2005 Wimbledon-2010 Australian Open (also 18 of 21).  Federer's Historic Push: A victory Sunday would make Federer, 34, the first player in the Open Era to win six US Open titles and the oldest US Open champion since 35-year-old Ken Rosewall in 1970. Should he win in straight sets, Federer will clinch his second Grand Slam title without dropping a set (also 2007 Australian Open) and be the first US Open champion to do so in the Open Era. Neale Fraser was the last at the 1960 US Open.  Big Four Lead The Way: Since 2005 Roland Garros, when Rafael Nadal won his first Grand Slam title, the ‘Big Four’ of Djokovic, Federer, Nadal and Andy Murray has accounted for 39 of 43 major titles (including Sunday’s winner). The only titles they did not win were the 2009 US Open (del Potro), 2014 Australian Open (Stan Wawrinka), 2014 US Open (Cilic) and 2015 Roland Garros (Wawrinka).  Rivalry For The Ages: Djokovic and Federer (42 matches) have met more than any other two players in the Open Era except Djokovic and Nadal (44). The pair’s respective coaches, Boris Becker and Stefan Edberg met 35 times.  Second To None At Majors: This is Djokovic and Federer’s 14th Grand Slam encounter, which sets a new record for most meetings at the majors.    Djokovic In Grand Slam Finals: This is the 4th Grand Slam final meeting between Djokovic and Federer, and their 2nd straight major final this season. Djokovic has won the last two – at Wimbledon in 2014 and 2015 – after Federer won the first at the 2007 US Open. Djokovic has a 9-8 win-loss record overall in 17 Grand Slam finals and a 1-4 win-loss record in US Open finals. His only win in a US Open final came over Rafael Nadal in 2011.  All-Time Grand Slam Title Leaders: Djokovic is looking to move up to the No. 7 spot and tie Bill Tilden on the all-time Grand Slam singles titles list:   Elite Company: Djokovic is just the 3rd man in the Open Era to reach all four Grand Slam finals in a calendar year. No. 1 vs No. 2: The Top 2 seeds have met in the US Open final 13 times during the Open Era, but only three times since 1996. Djokovic has been the No. 1 seed in all three of those finals.  Hard-Court Dominance: Since the start of the 2011 season, Djokovic has won more titles (26) on hard courts than he’s lost matches (25). Here is a look at his impressive record: Wimbledon Final Rematch: For just the 2nd time since 1981 and 6th time in the Open Era, the US Open final is a rematch of the Wimbledon final.  Federer Aiming For Sixth US Open Title: Having won the title five straight years from 2004-2008, Roger Federer is bidding to become the first man to win six or more US Open championships in the Open Era.  Six (Or More) Grand Slam Titles: Since the abolition of the Challenge rounds at the US Championships (1912) and Wimbledon (1922), only six men have won six or more titles at the same Grand Slam tournament. If Federer were to win the 2015 US Open, he would become the first man to win six or more titles at two different Grand Slam events.  Consecutive Sets Won: Since falling to Djokovic in the Wimbledon final, Federer has not dropped a set, sweeping his seventh ATP Masters 1000 Cincinnati title and his first six matches at the US Open. Federer’s 28-set winning streak matches the third-best of his career. He can tie the longest if he wins the US Open final in straight sets. Of Federer’s 17 major titles, he’s won only one without dropping a set (2007 Australian Open).  Sets Of Perfection: The US Open marks the fourth time that Federer has reached a major final without dropping a set. He has won every set at a Grand Slam once from start to finish, doing so for his 10th major title at the 2007 Australian Open. Should he defeat Djokovic in straight sets, Federer will become the first player in the Open Era to win the US Open without dropping a set. Neale Fraser was the last to do so in 1960.  30+ Grand Slam Champions: Federer, who won Wimbledon in 2012 at the age of 30, is looking to become the fifth man in the Open Era to win multiple Grand Slams titles after his 30th birthday.  Career Hard Court Title Leaders: Federer is the Open Era hard-court titles leader with 59. Djokovic is 4th.  Federer in Grand Slam Finals: Federer has a 17-9 record in Grand Slam finals, highlighted by a 5-1 mark at the US Open – his best finals record at any of the majors. Since starting his career 7-0 in Grand Slam finals, Federer is 10-9, including consecutive losses to Djokovic at Wimbledon in 2014 and 2015.",Novak Djokovic won the US Open in 2015.
Who won Indian Wells in 2022?,"Rafael Nadal will aim to write another historic chapter into his legendary career on Sunday when he faces American Taylor Fritz in the BNP Paribas Open final.  The Spaniard has been red-hot this season, with his three-set semi-final victory over #NextGenATP Spaniard Carlos Alcaraz extending his personal-best start to a year to 20-0. If the World No. 4 can defeat Fritz in the championship match, he will clinch a record-equalling 37th ATP Masters 1000 crown, drawing level with Novak Djokovic.  The fourth seed, who has spent over 12 hours on court en route to the final, is delighted with his run in the California desert and is ready for a tough test against Fritz.  “Being in the final here in Indian Wells means a lot to me,” Nadal said following his win over Alcaraz. “[It] is a very special place. A match like today helps for the confidence. I know I will need to be ready physically and mentally, in terms of playing at a very high level of tennis because he's playing well.  “[Fritz played a] super aggressive match against a very difficult player to play like Rublev. I think he played with great determination and very aggressively. I saw a lot of the match and he played very well.” While Nadal prepares to compete in his 53rd Masters 1000 final, Fritz will be playing in his first after he edged Andrey Rublev 7-5, 6-4 on Saturday to maintain his impressive record in Indian Wells.  The World No. 20 is a California native and is the first American man to advance to the championship match at the Indian Wells Tennis Garden since John Isner in 2012. If Fritz can go one step further and upset Nadal, he will become the first man from his country to lift the Indian Wells trophy since Andre Agassi in 2001.  ""It doesn't even seem real,” Fritz said after his win against Rublev. “I'm just trying to take in the moment, regroup and come back tomorrow for the final. But it's a dream come true.  “These moments are the reason why I wanted to be an athlete, wanted to play professional tennis. It's the best part of it all.”  Fritz is now 9-1 in Indian Wells in the past six months, having also reached the semi-finals in October when the event was moved from March 2021 due to the Covid-19 pandemic.  He has notched impressive wins against Top 10 stars Matteo Berrettini, Alexander Zverev and Rublev across the two editions of the event and is projected to climb into the Top 15 of the ATP Rankings on Monday. Nadal will carry a 1-0 ATP Head2Head series lead into the match after he triumphed 6-3, 6-2 in their clash in the final in Acapulco in 2020. It is an encounter Fritz is aiming to learn from as he gears up for the biggest match of his career.  “I remember I felt he played high spinny balls to me and almost gave me a lot of forehands in my favourite spot at shoulder height,” Fritz said. “I think he just kept doing it until I missed eventually.  “I kind of beat myself trying to fire off winners against him. I think my level is so much higher than then, so I won't be feeling I need to pull the trigger so much. I can kind of play more within myself.” This week, Fritz has eliminated Kamil Majchrzak, Jaume Munar, Alex de Minaur, Miomir Kecmanovic as well as Rublev, while Nadal has taken out Sebastian Korda, Daniel Evans, Reilly Opelka, Nick Kyrgios and Alcaraz.  Nadal has enjoyed a remarkable 2022 season, winning titles at the Melbourne Summer Set and the Abierto Mexicano Telcel presentado por HSBC, while he won a record-breaking 21st Grand Slam trophy at the Australian Open. The 35-year-old is projected to rise to No. 3 on Monday.  Meanwhile, Fritz earned ATP Cup victories over Felix Auger-Aliassime and Cameron Norrie before reaching the fourth round at Melbourne Park. The 20th seed, who lifted the trophy in Eastbourne in 2019, will be aiming to win his second tour-level title when he plays Nadal on Stadium 1 at 3:00 p.m. local time.",Taylor Fritz won Indian Wells in 2022.
Who won Miami in 2022?,"Casper Ruud and Carlos Alcaraz had something in common when they arrived in Miami two weeks ago – neither player knew what it was like to win a match at the ATP Masters 1000 event in southern Florida.  Five victories later and having dropped just a single set each en route to Sunday’s final, both players have rectified that record in spectacular fashion. On Sunday each has the opportunity to cap a dream run in Miami by clinching a maiden Masters 1000 crown.  After losing his three previous Masters 1000 semi-finals – all on his favoured clay – sixth seed Ruud broke his final-four duck in style on Friday with a 6-4, 6-1 win over Argentine Francisco Cerundolo. The Norwegian's clean ball-striking off both wings has looked ready-made for the Miami hard courts but the World No. 8 admits to still being pleasantly surprised at his progress at Hard Rock Stadium.  “It was not where I imagined myself playing my first Masters 1000 final [on a hard court], but I will take it,” Ruud said after defeating Cerundolo. “It is a great feeling, and I am enjoying the city and the tournament.” Of Ruud’s nine tour-level finals to date, eight have been on clay. Yet his 2021 season included quarter-final runs at the National Bank Open Presented by Rogers in Toronto, the Western & Southern Open in Cincinnati and the Rolex Paris Masters. Those hard-court performances helped the Norwegian qualify for the year-end Nitto ATP Finals for the first time and have quietened any talk of him being only suited to the red dirt.  “I think last year, when I reached the fourth round of the Australian Open, [it] kind of gave me a confidence boost on the surface,” said Ruud, who is the first Norwegian to reach a Masters 1000 championship match. “Because I never felt too bad on hard courts, but it's just that my game seems to suit the clay a little bit better. My biggest results were on clay up until last year. I think they still are. But now here I have a final.  “Obviously the Nitto ATP Finals was kind of what topped everything when I reached the semis. That was a big result. Even though now coming into hard court tournaments, I think my mindset is a little bit different.”  This confidence has been on full display throughout his run in Miami so far. After securing his first victory against Henri Laaksonen in the second round, Ruud took out Alexander Bublik, Cameron Norrie and World No. 4 Alexander Zverev for the biggest win of his career before his triumph over Cerundolo. The Norwegian now holds a 13-3 record for the 2022 season, a tally that includes a seventh ATP Tour title clinched in Buenos Aires in February. His next task is to stop Alcaraz from becoming the youngest men’s champion in Miami tournament history, but that will take some doing. The Spaniard has lit up Hard Rock Stadium with a string of dazzling performances to the delight of the Miami fans, the latest of which was his 7-6(5), 7-6(2) win over defending Hubert Hurkacz on Friday evening.  ""I have a lot of emotions right now,” said Alcaraz after battling past the Pole to reach the biggest final of his young career. “It's something that you dream of when you are a child. It's really good to be in the final here in Miami. I love playing here. The crowd is amazing. I'm going to approach the final like a first round, trying to mask the nerves. I'm going to enjoy it, it's going to be a great final.""  The Spaniard may still be a month shy of his 19th birthday, but he already appears at ease on the big stage. Even disappointments such as his three-set semi-final defeat to Rafael Nadal at the BNP Paribas Open in Indian Wells in March will stand him in good stead, the Spaniard believes.  “It was a great match against Rafa,” said Alcaraz after his win over Hurkacz on Friday. “I think that I played a great match against him. But I think that I learned how to play in a semi-final in a Masters 1000. It was my first one, so now [in the] second one I managed to do much better than in Indian Wells.  “It was different match, but I think that the nerves, the tough moments, I managed better in this one than Indian Wells.” Alcaraz has certainly shown he can handle pressure throughout his Miami run. The 14th seed has been broken just twice in the tournament so far, saving 15 break points across his wins over Marton Fucsovics, Marin Cilic, Stefanos Tsitsipas, Miomir Kecmanovic and Hurkacz.  Alcaraz’s form in Miami has only been a continuation of a red-hot start to 2022 that included a maiden ATP 500 title claimed in Rio de Janeiro in February. The Hurkacz win took the reigning Intesa Sanpaolo Next Gen ATP Finals champion to a 17-2 record for the season, and he will move from his current ranking of No. 16 to the brink of the Top 10 in Monday's edition of the ATP Rankings regardless of the result on Sunday. Like the rest of the tennis world, Ruud has been impressed by Alcaraz’s mature displays. “I think we all can see like how talented he is, that he has a very good mind for tennis,” said the Norweigan. “He understands the game very well. He knows when to hit certain shots and when probably not to.""  The Spaniard leads the pair’s ATP Head2Head series 1-0 after upsetting Ruud in straight sets at the ATP 250 event in Marbella a year ago. Alcaraz has spoken openly about the physical improvements he has made since then and has produced some stunning all-court tennis in Miami, but Ruud nonetheless remains confident that he can be the one to end the youngster’s dream run.  “He is, at his highest level, very, very good, but he also plays high risk, I think, so he goes for the shots quite often,"" Ruud said when asked about his opponent in Sunday's final. ""Hopefully if I play him he will miss a couple of those.  “I played him last year. I think he played a very good match. You know, I barely had any chance at all, I felt like, so I would try to seek revenge of course. He was just coming out firing flames at me. I will try to use that and think I would like to get some revenge.”",Carlos Alcaraz Garfia won Miami in 2022.
Who won Monte Carlo in 2022?,"One man stands between Stefanos Tsitsipas and back-to-back Rolex Monte-Carlo Masters titles on Sunday. The unseeded Alejandro Davidovich Fokina, playing in his first ATP Tour final, has already beaten World No. 1 Novak Djokovic this week in Monaco. One more upset could surpass that as the biggest win of the 22-year-old's career.   In the doubles final, two longtime pairings and 2021 Nitto ATP Finals competitors will seek their first title of the 2022 season as top seeds Rajeev Ram and Joe Salisbury face sixth-seeded Colombians Juan Sebastian Cabal and Robert Farah. After coming from behind to win a late-night classic against Diego Schwartzman in the quarter-finals, Tsitsipas recovered quickly to dominate Alexander Zverev, 6-4, 6-2, in the semis. That efficient result should leave him in good stead for the last leg of his title defence.   “It’s going to take a little bit more,” said Tsitsipas, looking ahead to his third ATP Head2Head meeting with Davidovich Fokina. “He’s on a good run, in a good rhythm. I’ve played him before, he’s a good opponent, I’ve had big battles against him and I’m going to try and be as ready as possible.  “I know he’s improved from before and I’m going to have that in the back of my head, to produce the best tennis that I can.”  Tsitsipas and Davidovich Fokina met one year ago in the Monte Carlo quarter-finals, with the Spaniard retiring after dropping a 7-5 opening set. Their second meeting came in February, when Tsitsipas scored a 7-5, 6-7(1), 6-4 win in Rotterdam. 'Foki' is the first unseeded Monte Carlo finalist since Dusan Lajovic in 2019. He advanced to his first ATP Tour final in his fourth semi-final attempt, battling past Grigor Dimitrov, 6-4, 6-7(2), 6-3.  “I am so, so happy to be in the final. It is a dream come true,” Davidovich Fokina said following his semi-final win. “When I was a kid I was dreaming about this day.""  After describing the hard work he and his team have put in since preseason in December, he later added: “Now I am in the final, I will enjoy it and try my best.”  The Spaniard has already knocked off three ATP Masters 1000 champions on the way to the final: Djokovic, Taylor Fritz and Dimitrov. If he can take out a fourth, he will achieve the rare feat of winning his first tour-level title at that elite level. In a doubles final well-deserving of center stage on Court Rainier III, two multiple Grand Slam-winning teams seek their best result of the 2022 season.  These teams have met five times before, with four of those matches requiring either a Match Tie-break or a third-set tie-break. Ram and Salisbury, who lead the ATP Head2Head series 4-1, took all four of those tie-breaks, including three in 2021 (Eastbourne, Wimbledon, Nitto ATP Finals).   But Cabal and Farah won the only final contested between the teams, scoring a straight-sets win to take the 2021 Vienna title.  Both teams have dropped just one set en route to the championship match, setting up for a grand finale on Sunday.",Stefanos Tsitsipas won Monte Carlo in 2022.
Who won Madrid in 2022?,"The Caja Magica has proved a fitting name for the Mutua Madrid Open venue this week, with home favourite Carlos Alcaraz embarking on a magical run to the final at the ATP Masters 1000 event. After beating Rafael Nadal and Novak Djokovic for the first time to set up a title tilt against defending champion Alexander Zverev, the 19-year-old seeks his first win in three tries against the German on Sunday.  Should Alcaraz take the title Sunday, he will move to second place in the Pepperstone ATP Race To Turin, just 70 points behind Nadal, making it highly likely that he will eventually qualify for the year-end Nitto ATP Finals.  Before the singles final, Colombians Juan Sebastian Cabal and Robert Farah will take on in-form duo Wesley Koolhof and Neal Skupski for the doubles crown. Zverev holds a 2-0 ATP Head2Head advantage over Alcaraz following a pair of dominant hard-court victories last season in Acapulco and Vienna. But the Spaniard has reached a stratospheric level in recent months, winning three ATP Tour titles and compiling a 5-2 record against Top 10 opponents.  Alcaraz enters the final with a 27-3 record on the season, level with Stefanos Tsitsipas for the most in the ATP Tour, while Zverev is not far behind at 21-7.  The 19-year-old is undefeated in his four previous tour-level finals, and on Sunday can become the youngest five-time champion since Nadal won seven titles by the same age in 2004-05. All that success made Alcaraz the newest member of the Top 10 himself entering this week, and his final run has lifted three more places to No. 6 in the Pepperstone ATP Live Rankings.  But Zverev has proven to be the man to beat in Madrid, and will enter the final with a 19-2 record as a two-time champion in the Spanish capital (2018, 2021). Still, he downplayed his chances in the final against the red-hot fan favourite after seeing him take out Nadal and Djokovic in succession.  ""Nothing that surprises me,"" Zverev said of those results, ""because I know how good he is. I said last year in Acapulco that by 2023 he's going to be Top 10. He beat me by a year. There's nothing more to say. He's an incredible player. He's going to be incredible. At 19 years old now, he looks like a grown man. To be honest, there's no limit for him."" Alcaraz did not know his final opponent after getting past Djokovic in the first semi-final, but was already making his recovery plans when he spoke with the press following that match. Not only will the Spaniard have to recover physically following that three-hour, 35-minute battle, he must reset mentally after defeating two tennis legends in as many days.  ""After today's match, of course with my team, with my family, we are going to have a great time to enjoy the moment. But I think that tomorrow I'm going to play a final of a really big tournament, and tonight I'm going to be very focussed to be able to recover and to [play] as best as possible for tomorrow's match.""  Zverev also went three sets in the semis, against Tsitsipas, but needed less than two hours to advance in relatively dominant fashion. Despite the shorter match time, Zverev did not wrap up the win until near 1 a.m. due to a late start. Nonetheless, he said post-match that he planned to return to the court to practise ahead ahead of facing his ""toughest opponent of the week"" in the final. He did the same after a late quarter-final finish against Felix Auger-Aliassime and has made a habit of post-match practises in recent times.   A look at the Balance of Power and Conversion & Steal metrics for the finalists paints an intriguing picture ahead of what may lie ahead. Both men are above average in Balance of Power, which measures the percentage of shots hit from an attacking position. Zverev is 11 percentage points above average at converting points from those attacking positions, while Alcaraz's standout stat is the ""steal"" — he wins 42 percent of points in which his opponent gains an attacking advantage, beating the Tour average by seven percentage points.  The below figures were calculated from both finalists' four matches in Madrid.",Carlos Alcaraz Garfia won Madrid in 2022.
Who won Rome in 2022?,"Novak Djokovic has had a lot on the line all week at the Internazionali BNL d'Italia, and nothing will change on Sunday in the Rome final against Stefanos Tsitsipas.   The World No. 1 slipped to No. 2 in the Pepperstone ATP Live Rankings entering the week before his quarter-final victory over Felix Auger-Aliassime moved him back to the top spot ahead of Daniil Medvedev. Djokovic then downed Casper Ruud in the semis to earn his 1,000th tour-level win and guarantee himself the top seed at Roland Garros.   Playing in his fourth straight Rome final, and his 12th overall in the Italian capital, the Serbian now seeks a record-extending 38th ATP Masters 1000 title against Tsitsipas. The Greek is bidding for his second title of 2022 after he successfully defended his Monte Carlo crown in April. The most recent ATP Head2Head meeting between these two men came last year in the Roland Garros final, when Djokovic battled back from two sets down to win his 20th Grand Slam title. Just prior to that, the Serbian engineered another comeback to defeat Tsitsipas in the Rome quarter-finals. He leads the overall series 6-2, including a perfect 4-0 on clay.  Djokovic is hot on the trail of his first title of 2022 as he begins to hit top form late in the European clay season. After an early exit in Monte Carlo, he reached the final in his native Belgrade and the semis in Madrid. He has not dropped a set this week in Rome, dominating Aslan Karatsev and Stan Wawrinka before winning closer-yet-still-comfortable contests against Felix Auger-Aliassime and Casper Ruud. Tsitsipas survived a pair of match points against him to defeat Grigor Dimitrov in the Rome opening round and later scored a pair of comeback wins against Karen Khachanov (third round) and Alexander Zverev (semis). In between, he ended the run of home favourite Jannik Sinner in straight sets.  The Greek enters the final in scintillating form with a 14-2 record on the clay swing. He backed up his Monte Carlo title with a run to the Barcelona quarters and the Madrid semis and avenged a loss to Zverev in the Madrid with his win on Saturday. His 31 tour-level wins on the season lead the ATP Tour.  Tsitsipas is competing in his first Rome final, and enters the title match with a 9-4 record at the ATP Masters 1000 event.  “It’s one of those tournaments that I think has the most history in sport,"" he said upon reaching the final. ""As you can see looking around the sides, one of the most beautiful stadiums. There’s a lot of history playing on these courts and you feel very proud that you made your way here and are able to participate in such a historically rich event.” Djokovic faces a quick turnaround after his evening win over Ruud, which was followed by an on-court celebration for his 1,000 wins, complete with a themed cake. He will look to extend his perfect record to 4-0 against Tsitsipas in finals.  ""Another final against him at one of the biggest tournaments we have in the world,"" Djokovic previewed. ""He's definitely in form. The last few years he's been [one of the] top two, three clay-court players. In general, top two, three in the world.  ""But especially on the clay court, winning Monte Carlo, always reaching the final stages of the biggest events on clay. I can expect a big battle on the court, but I'm ready for it.""  The Balance of Power and Steal & Conversion Insights provide an interesting backdrop for Sunday's match. The standout statistic from this week in Rome is Djokovic's 42 per cent steal rate, which describes how often the Serbian wins points from defence. That could prove crucial in the final, with Tsitsipas edging the Balance of Power battle between the pair, playing 25 per cent of his shots in attack this week. Both men are above average in how often they convert points from attacking positions.",Novak Djokovic won Rome in 2022.
Who won Toronto in 2022?,"Hubert Hurkacz is one of the shyest, most soft-spoken players on the ATP Tour.  You wouldn’t know it by the way 25-year-old from Poland drives. (He was once spotted behind the wheel of a gleaming-yellow McLaren 720S in the Southern California desert, and says if he hadn’t gone into the tennis business he might have pursued a career in auto racing.)  Or the way he serves — a stroke that has fast become one of the loudest, engine-revving weapons on the circuit. As we’ve seen this week at the National Bank Open Presented by Rogers, it’s a shot that has helped him out of many a sticky situation. In fact, all four of the World No. 10 Pole’s victories in Montreal, including his 5-7, 6-3, 6-2 dismissal of fourth seed Casper Ruud in Saturday’s semi-final, have gone the distance, his serve often the difference-maker. He smacked 23 aces in his opener against Albert Ramos-Vinolas, 16 against Emil Ruusuvuori, 20 against Nick Kyrgios, and another 18 against Ruud, giving him a tournament-leading 77 (and counting) on the week.  Oh, how those free points can come in handy in a pinch.  “He’s got one of the best serves in the world,” said Kyrgios, a power-server himself, but now winless in two ATP Head2Heads with Hurkacz in 2022. Hurkacz is now into his second ATP Masters 1000 hard-court final, having won the first in Miami in 2021 (def. Jannik Sinner, 7-6(4), 6-4). He comes in as the favourite against Pablo Carreno Busta of Spain, who has climbed seven spots this week to No. 16 in the Pepperstone ATP Live Rankings. The 31-year-old Spaniard is into the first ATP Masters 1000 final of his career.  Hurkacz is a perfect five-for-five in finals coming into Sunday’s title tilt.  “I just try to give myself the best chance,” said the eighth seed. “I just try to compete as hard as I can, be as well prepared as I can. I was fortunate to win the first few finals. But tomorrow is going to be a new match. It's going to be a very tricky one.”   Carreno Busta didn’t drop a set all week until Brit Daniel Evans pushed him to three in a thrilling 7-5, 6-7(7), 6-2 semi-final. The two-time US Open semi-finalist, raised on clay, continues to show his considerable all-surface skills. It’s taken the Spaniard, who turned pro back in 2009, some time to reach this stage, but as he asked after his escape against Evans, “Why not now?” “It’s probably one of the worst years of my career, with not really good results,” he laughed. “I did make the final in Barcelona, the semi-finals in Bastad, but now, I don’t know why, this week the level was unbelievable. I’m excited. It’s a big opportunity for me to know how to do it. For me, for my confidence, it’s very important to go on court tomorrow and try to do my best, to be aggressive and play my tennis.”  The finalists have split their two previous encounters, both coming in 2021 on hard courts: Carreno Busta prevailed in a Round-of-16 matchup in Cincinnati, 7-6(2), 6-3, while Hurkacz answered in the Metz final, 7-6(2), 6-3.",Pablo Carreno Busta won Toronto in 2022.
Who won Cincinnati in 2022?,"Borna Coric has had ‘that look’ in his eye all week long at the Western & Southern Open; a kind of single-minded glower that could only belong to someone who’s been denied their livelihood for far too long.  That look was there when the 25-year-old Croatian, limited to just nine matches in 2021 due to right shoulder surgery, stunned Rafael Nadal 7-6(9), 4-6, 6-3 in the second round, only his fifth tour-level win since returning to competition in March. It was there again in successive straight-sets dismissals of seeds Roberto Bautista Agut (6-2, 6-3), Felix Auger-Aliassime (6-4, 6-4) and Cameron Norrie (6-3, 6-4) en route to his first ATP Masters 1000 final since Shanghai in 2018. All those hours of rehab, all those hours on the practice court? They’re beginning to pay off.  “I was really working very hard in the last six months,” said Coric, who arrived in Cincinnati an unaccustomed No. 152 in the Pepperstone ATP Rankings and became the lowest-ranked finalist in tournament history. “I think once you are in the Top 20 or Top 30, you can get a little bit sloppy and maybe get away with it. But once you fall down to No. 200 — I don’t know where I was, but I knew I needed to work probably three times harder than I used to work, and that’s what I did. For the last six months, I was really focussed. I kept my head down even when I was losing.”  On Sunday, Coric will face fourth seed Stefanos Tsitsipas, a 7-6(6), 3-6, 6-3 winner over World No. 1 and 2019 champion Daniil Medvedev in his rain-delayed semi-final at the Lindner Family Tennis Center. Third time’s a charm for the Greek star, who after stalling in the semis the past two years in Cincinnati is finally through to the title match. Tsitsipas, who now owns a tour-leading 46 match wins on the year, is into his second career ATP Masters 1000 hard-court final after Toronto in 2018.  “I’m prepared for it. I know it’s not an easy task playing against him,” said the 24-year-old Tsitsipas, an ATP Masters 1000 titlist the past two years in Monte Carlo. “He’s coming back from an injury, he’s playing great tennis, and he’s going to work very hard for it.” The finalists have split their two ATP Head2Heads with Coric claiming their most recent encounter in a 2020 US Open epic, battling back from two-sets-to-one down and saving six match points to prevail, 6-7(2), 6-4, 4-6, 7-5, 7-6(4).  In his own words, Coric has ""gambled"" this week with his surgically repaired shoulder, especially from the service stripe. He’ll roll the dice again opposite his next opponent, against whom he’ll need to be ready for anything. Tsitsipas showed plenty of variety in upending Medvedev, coming into net 36 times and mixing in some well-timed serve-and-volley plays.  “I don’t have much to lose,” said Coric. “I have done everything that I could this week and more than I expected, so I’m just going to go out there and enjoy my time tomorrow on the court.”",Borna Coric won Cincinnati in 2022.
Who won Paris in 2022?,"Holger Rune had just broken into the Top 150 of the Pepperstone ATP Rankings before his first meeting with Novak Djokovic at the 2021 US Open. Now, the 19-year-old Dane has a chance to make his Top 10 debut with a win against the Serbian in Sunday's Rolex Paris Masters final (3pm CET/9am ET).  The #NextGenATP star has shown that the future is now by reaching four straight finals during the indoor season, and he rides an 18-2 record during that stretch into his clash with Djokovic. After snapping Felix Auger-Aliassime's 16-match win streak in the semis, the Stockholm champion will seek his fifth Top 10 win in as many days in his first ATP Masters 1000 final. He will need to end Djokovic's twin 13-match winning runs to earn it, with the Serbian streaking both in Paris — where he won the title in both 2019 and 2021 — and overall. With wins against Hubert Hurkacz, Andrey Rublev, Carlos Alcaraz and Auger-Aliassime on the week, Rune has soared six spots to No. 12 in the Pepperstone ATP Live Rankings. Victory against Djokovic would also move him into 10th place in the Pepperstone ATP Live Race To Turin, which would make him the fist alternate at the Nitto ATP Finals.  Defending Paris champ Djokovic, who dropped a set to Rune in their US Open first-round meeting, has seen the Dane's rise first-hand.  ""I know him quite well because we have trained on different surfaces,"" said the six-time Bercy titlist. ""I really like him. Very nice guy, great family, great team of people around him. Fantastic work ethic that he has, and he deserves his success. I followed him the last three, four years, his uprising through the Challenger level and then getting now to Top 15 in the world.  ""No doubt that he's the future of the sport, along with Alcaraz and some other guys. Hopefully I can [delay] his first title [at a] Masters 1000 event,"" Djokovic added with a smile. While the pair are good friends, the Serbian is prepared for a battle in the final against one of the in-form players on the ATP Tour.  ""We get along really well. Good friends off the court. Of course on the court, [we are] competitors,"" he said. ""I played him only once last US Open, a good battle, four sets. He has improved a lot, no doubt. He physically is a very fit guy. He's young, so not much to lose. Just swinging through the ball.  ""I expect that also tomorrow. I saw him play today. Yesterday, it was just a very impressive game. Kind of reminds me of myself, solid backhand and very good defence and just competitive, every point leaving his heart and his legs out there on the court. It's nice to see that. I think he's very good for our sport in general.""  INSIGHTS data shows how closely the finalists stack up in terms of Shot Quality — measured on a 10-point scale — with Rune holding an edge on serve but Djokovic scoring higher on return, forehand and backhand this week. Rune has also played more points In Attack in reaching the final, while Djokovic has recorded a stronger Conversion rate from offensive positions and and a better Steal rate from defence. Rune has not dropped a set in Paris since he lost the opener against Stan Wawrinka in the first round, rising to new heights in a 6-4, 6-2 win against Auger-Aliassime on Saturday. Following his semi-final victory, which he called ""an unbelievable match from my side"", Rune singled out his backhand as a key part of his attacking game plan.  “I saw some statistic that [my] backhand is going well in this tournament,” he said. “So I tried to use that a little bit, especially against Felix who has such a great forehand and serve.  “It’s good to play the game more on that side, and that was what I tried to do. To put pressure there, move him around, and it worked really well. I really feel the groundstrokes, the returns were much better than I did the last time I played.” Djokovic faced a much tougher test in his semi-final against Stefanos Tsitsipas, winning the final four points of the match to clinch a 6-2, 3-6, 7-6(4) victory.  The Serbian is seeking his seventh Paris title and his 56th at the Masters 1000 level, both of which would extend his own records. He has claimed titles in each of his past four ATP Tour tournaments dating back to Wimbledon, winning 21 of his past 22 matches — a Laver Cup defeat to Auger-Aliassime his lone defeat.",Holger Rune won Paris in 2022.
Who won Indian Wells in 2021?,"Cameron Norrie’s breakthrough season is set to hit fever pitch on Sunday as he meets Georgian Nikoloz Basilashvili at the BNP Paribas Open in his first ATP Masters 1000 final.  The Brit started the year at No. 71 in the FedEx ATP Rankings but has earned a career-best 46 tour-level wins in 2021. Norrie’s run to his sixth ATP Tour final of the season in Indian Wells will propel him into the Top 20 for the first time and see him replace Daniel Evans as the new British No. 1 on Monday. If this was not enough for Norrie to get excited about, a spot at the Nitto ATP Finals, to be held at the Pala Alpitour in Turin from 14-21 November, is now firmly in view for the 26-year-old.  If Norrie can overcome Basilashvili and capture his second tour-level title of the season, having won his maiden trophy at this level in Los Cabos, he will soar to 10th place in the FedEx ATP Race To Turin. It will see the Brit just 160 points behind ninth-placed Hubert Hurkacz, who currently occupies the last qualifying spot, with Rafael Nadal, currently eighth, not competing due to a foot injury. Before this year, the Londoner had never won a main draw match in two previous appearances in Indian Wells. Following his semi-final victory over Grigor Dimitrov, Norrie became only the fourth Brit to reach the final in California.  “I think it's very special, especially looking at the other names, Greg, Tim and Andy, all British tennis icons and legends. To be added to that list is extremely special for me,” Norrie said. “The last two days have been the biggest matches of my career, so I'm going to go out there and it's going to be my biggest match of my career again.  “There's a lot of work to be done. I'm looking forward to the occasion. Feeling all the nerves and all the pressure, it's definitely great to experience that.” Norrie is aiming to become the first Brit to win the Masters 1000 hard-court event and will carry a 1-0 ATP Head2Head lead into his meeting with Basilashvili, having defeated the World No. 36 in Rotterdam in March.  Basilashvili will also be competing for the biggest title of his career on Sunday after he moved past American Taylor Fritz in straight sets to advance to his maiden Masters 1000 final and become the first Georgian to reach the championship match at this level. The 29-year-old had suffered five first-round defeats from six appearances at Masters 1000 level this year, but has enjoyed a dream run in the desert. Basilashvili upset World No. 3 Stefanos Tsitsipas in the quarter-finals and will be aiming to clinch his third tour-level crown of the season against Norrie after triumphing in Doha and Munich.  On facing Norrie, Basilashvili said: “[He is a] really interesting player. He's playing very well at this tournament. He had previous really good weeks. I will study him today and come up with a plan.  “But overall, he's not so nice to play against from the baseline. He's been playing really, really smart and very good tennis. I'm looking forward. If I can play my game and be relaxed, I think I can play well.” Norrie or Basilashvili will become the sixth different player to win a Masters 1000 title this season, joining Hubert Hurkacz, Tsitsipas, Alexander Zverev (twice), Rafael Nadal and Daniil Medvedev.",Cameron Norrie won Indian Wells in 2021.
Who won Miami in 2021?,"It’s safe to say that few predicted Hubert Hurkacz and Jannik Sinner would meet in the final of the first ATP Masters 1000 event of the season. But both men have a massive opportunity in Sunday's Miami Open presented by Itau championship clash and the big question is, who will take advantage of the moment?  Two of the nicest guys on Tour will step on Grandstand in South Florida for the biggest match of their young careers Sunday, but only one can walk off as the winner. Hurkacz and Sinner have never competed against one another, nor has either player previously reached a Masters 1000 final. But the two-time doubles partners will turn into rivals, at least for a day.  “Jannik is a great person. I think like it's super, super calm and super chill, and also he's good person. He's a really nice guy and he really wants it hard, [he] competes to win,” Hurkacz said. “He's a really, really great guy. The results that he has [are] obviously because of his hard work.” The Miami opponents count each other as friends. But they have to put their friendship aside and focus on the task at hand. A win on Sunday will be the biggest of the champion’s career. Although Hurkacz and Sinner have both enjoyed incredible runs thus far, there is still plenty at stake.  Sinner is just the fourth teen to reach the Miami final. The other three who have accomplished the feat — Andre Agassi, Rafael Nadal and Novak Djokovic — have all climbed to No. 1 in the FedEx ATP Rankings. A victory would make the #NextGenATP Italian the youngest titlist in tournament history.  “It’s a great result here,” Sinner said. “But first, I have one more match in front of me.” The 19-year-old is the youngest Masters 1000 finalist since Nadal triumphed at the 2005 Mutua Madrid Open. He isn’t allowing himself to get wrapped up in the attention he is receiving, though. While the teen is happy that his achievements are putting him in elite company, Sinner is fully focussed on beating Hurkacz.  “We came here I think with the right mentality, with the right mindset. We always go to every tournament to win, trying to win as many matches as possible,” Sinner said. “Some weeks you do better and some weeks you do a little bit worse, but I think I have a good team behind me who can show me many, many things.” Sinner knows Hurkacz will be a difficult opponent, telling Tennis Channel on Friday that, “Hurkacz has [had] a very good run here. He can play very, very good.”  The Polish No. 1 has dismissed back-to-back Top 10 opponents, eliminating World No. 5 Stefanos Tsitsipas and World No. 8 Andrey Rublev. It has been an impressive road to the final considering he began the week having lost five of his previous seven matches.  “Obviously I was just trying to work on my game and play my best tennis,” Hurkacz said. “Luckily and happily, I’m here in the finals now.” It should be an interesting tactical match. Sinner is one of the cleanest hitters on the ATP Tour and although Hurkacz is 6’5” and can play aggressively — as he showed against Rublev and Tsitsipas — he excels with his movement. Some have compared the Pole to former World No. 1 Andy Murray. Wojtek Fibak, the only other Polish ATP Tour titlist, who reached the Top 10 in singles and doubles, expects a good match on Sunday.  “They are very similar. They have all the same characteristics: serve, backhand, forehand, movement, tall guys, big serves. Maybe the second serve of Hubert is a bit better, more consistent. And I think Hubert has more experience, because he’s been on the Tour longer,” Fibak told ATPTour.com. “Tomorrow I think will be a bit closer because of all the weapons Sinner has. He has the same weapons as Hubert. He knows how to play at the net… he has the same talent and he’s working hard, but he’s only 19.”  The battle could come down to who is more clutch in the big moments. Hurkacz and Sinner have saved 78 and 74 per cent of the break points they have faced this tournament, respectively. Will the Pole shine for his country, or will Sinner continue his rapid rise?  “I’m happy about what I was able to do this week,” Sinner said. “There is one more match in front of me, so I'm trying to play my tennis.”",Hubert Hurkacz won Miami in 2021.
Who won Monte Carlo in 2021?,"For the second straight ATP Masters 1000 event, a new champion will be lifting his first trophy at this level as Stefanos Tsitsipas takes on Andrey Rublev for the Rolex Monte-Carlo Masters title.  There will be more than just Monte-Carlo glory on the line for Tsitsipas and Rublev. The winner will head the FedEx ATP Race To Turin leaderboard for a place at the Nitto ATP Finals on Monday. Rublev has already overtaken current leader Novak Djokovic with his performance this week, though Tsitsipas could still rise to the top spot with a victory in the clay-court final.   After letting a big chance slip away at the Miami Open presented by Itau, the first ATP Masters 1000 event without Roger Federer, Rafael Nadal or Novak Djokovic in 17 years, both players arrived in the Principality eager for redemption. Tsitsipas and Rublev made strong showings in Miami, but were beaten by eventual champion Hubert Hurkacz in the quarter-finals and semi-finals, respectively. Sixth seed Rublev revealed that the key to bouncing back and reaching his first Masters 1000 final this week has been to keep a tight lid on his emotions – a lesson he learned the hard way in South Florida.  “That's why I lost [in Miami], because of my emotions,” Rublev said after his semi-final victory. “In the end if you want to learn, you will improve this. I hope I want to learn and I want to improve. That's why I'm doing better. Of course, it's not easy. [In] some matches [there] will still be up and downs.” The Russian claimed his first victory over Nadal (1-2) on the Spaniard’s favourite surface and after weathering a second-set comeback to triumph 6-4, 2-6, 6-2. It felt like a coming-of-age moment for the 23-year-old, who has an ATP Tour-best 24-4 match record in 2021. The tennis world seemed to be waiting for Rublev to find a way to translate his electrifying performances at ATP 500-level to the big stages at Masters 1000 events, and he did so against arguably the toughest opponent possible with a defeat of the 11-time former champion. But he passed another big test in the next round, staying calm in order to back up the win against unseeded Casper Ruud 6-3, 7-5 and reach the championship match.  “This week looks like I'm really controlling my emotions [very well]. That's why I'm doing well,” Rublev explained. “That's why I won the match with Robert when I was losing. That's why I won the match against Rafa when he came back in [the] second set. Even today [in] the second set, I come back because I didn't go crazy. I just keep focused. I keep staying in the match. It turned around.” Rublev will take on two-time Masters 1000 finalist Tsitsipas for the second time in 2021 when they hit Court Rainier III on Sunday. The pair has already met six times in their ATP Head2Head series (3-3), including three matches last year and also at last month’s ABN AMRO World Tennis Tournament in Rotterdam.  The Greek player has been in world-beating form this week in Monte-Carlo, where he also lives and trains. Tsitsipas hasn’t dropped a set all week, grounding Dubai champion Aslan Karatsev in his opening match, and cruising against Cristian Garin and breakout semi-finalist Daniel Evans. He also beat Alejandro Davidovich Fokina (7-5, ret.) along the way. “I'm feeling good. I'm feeling energised. I still have plenty of gas and energy left in me,” Tsitsipas said. “I was able to have all of my matches done in two sets, so that is I would say a big plus. I am happy to be able to play that way, just take it match by match, approach each individual match with the same intensity and energy. That has obviously contributed to that, to be able to finish the matches in two sets, not go to three-setters.”   Five-time ATP Tour titlist Tsitsipas is looking to lift his biggest trophy in Monte-Carlo after his 2019 Nitto ATP Finals triumph at The O2 in London. A victory would also be his first championship at an ATP 500, ATP Masters 1000 or Grand Slam tournament. By contrast, his opponent Rublev has swept 23 matches and four titles in a row at ATP 500 events from 2020-21.  It took a member of the Big Three to stop Tsitsipas in his previous Masters 1000 finals at the 2018 National Bank Open Presented by Rogers in Toronto (l. Nadal) and at the 2019 Mutua Madrid Open (l. Djokovic). Gearing up for his clash with Rublev, a first-time finalist at this level, Tsitsipas assured the press that he is not feeling any added pressure to get the job done. “It's not so much about that. It's more how much I really want it,” Tsitsipas said. “That doesn't necessarily add pressure to me. It's just pure determination, willingness to go over the top to get what I want. I don't like to think as it of pressure. I wouldn't call it that way.”  In the first match on Court Rainier III, Evans will hope to complete his dream week in Monte-Carlo with the ultimate prize as he partners with countryman Neal Skupski in the championship doubles clash. The pair has reached back-to-back Masters 1000 finals in Miami and Monte-Carlo, the first two tournaments of their new partnership. The Brits will have a chance to avenge their South Florida defeat on Sunday as they’ve booked a rematch with second seeds Nikola Mektic and Mate Pavic.",Stefanos Tsitsipas won Monte Carlo in 2021.
Who won Madrid in 2021?,"Alexander Zverev and Matteo Berrettini will face off in the final of the Mutua Madrid Open on Sunday with Zverev seeking his fourth ATP Masters 1000 title and Berretini looking to win his first.  While Berrettini has been in five ATP Tour finals, winning four of them, this will be his biggest final.   ""When you're about to play, you're just thinking that you're playing a final,"" Berrettini said. ""Obviously, I was in the semis [at the] US Open. Everything is different, but it's just a great feeling. Especially, after the struggle after my injury, I think I worked really hard. I'm maybe even more happy."" Zverev, who won the Madrid title in 2018, has yet to drop a set this week. The 23-year-old last won a clay-court title in Geneva in 2019, and if he wins on Sunday, it will mark his second title of 2021 after taking home the Acapulco title in March.  ""He's playing really good,"" Berrettini said of Zverev. ""He's solid; he moves well for his height. He serves well. He beat Rafa and Dominic, probably the best players on clay. It's going to be a challenging match, but I'm in the finals. I guess the best two guys are going to play each other.""  “He's been playing exceptionally well this week,” Zverev said of Berrettini. “I saw the end of last night where he won 11 games in a row. He was almost unplayable. He was hitting the ball so hard, serving extremely well. It's going to be difficult.” This week, the German has scored wins over Kei Nishikori, Daniel Evans, Rafael Nadal and Dominic Thiem. Friday marked his first win over Nadal on clay and third in a row against the World No. 2. In Saturday’s semi-final, Zverev eased past Thiem 6-3, 6-4, breaking serve three times to end a four-match losing streak against the Austrian.  “It’'s been two great matches for me,” Zverev said of his wins over Nadal and Thiem. “I think today [it] was a little bit of a weirder match because of the wind and the conditions. But all in all, it's been good. The job is not done yet. I hope I can do well tomorrow.”  Zverev enters Sunday’s final with a 14-2 record in the Spanish capital and a 2-1 ATP Head2Head Series record against Berrettini. All of their bouts have been at the ATP Masters 1000 level and they haven’t played each other since Zverev won their semi-final in Shanghai two years ago.  ""I remember that it was tough to return,"" Berrettini said. ""I remember he was serving really well. The times that we played each other in Rome, obviously they were different conditions, I remember in Shanghai I think the roof was closed, the court was very fast. I guess he just served better than me and I got broken twice. That was it.""  On Friday, playing in his second ATP Masters 1000 semi-final, Berrettini stormed back for a 5-7, 6-3, 6-0 win over Cristian Garin. In Saturday’s semi-final, the Italian took out Casper Ruud, 6-4, 6-4 by converting on 2/3 break point chances and facing zero break points of his own. It was the first time Ruud was broken all week.  ""I didn't expect this performance,"" Berrettini said. ""The key I think today was putting pressure on his serve, first serve and second serve. I was always trying to get the momentum and attacking even his first serve. I know that he likes to have time and run around the forehand. It worked out pretty well.""  The World No. 10 is on an eight-match win streak after capturing the ATP 250 in Belgrade. Though Sunday will be his first ATP Masters 1000 final, he has appeared in five finals, winning four of them.",Alexander Zverev won Madrid in 2021.
Who won Rome in 2021?,"Once again, the eternal duo is left standing in the Eternal City.  After a week of twists and turns, upsets and epics at the Internazionali BNL d’Italia, it will be top seed Novak Djokovic facing second seed Rafael Nadal in their sixth championship clash on Sunday.  Djokovic and Nadal have faced off a total of eight times before at the Foro Italico, dating back to their first meeting in the 2007 quarter-finals. Nadal won that match comfortably, but as their rivalry grew over the years so did the level of competition. The Spaniard owns a 5-3 lead in their Rome matchups, while Djokovic now boasts the overall ATP Head2Head edge in their legendary rivalry (29-27). Their combined dominance of this ATP Masters 1000 event has been something to behold: Djokovic and Nadal have won 14 of the past 16 editions, and at least one player has been in every Rome final dating back to 2005. Nadal has lifted a record nine trophies, while Djokovic has claimed five.  “It's great to play him again in the final. He's the guy that I have encountered the most in my career,” Djokovic said after his semi-final match. “[He is] definitely my biggest rival of all time. Playing him on clay in the finals of one of the biggest tournaments in the world is always extra motivating for me.  “Even after all we have been through in our careers there's still this excitement when we have to face each other.”  Sunday’s meeting will be a rematch of the 2009, 2011, 2012, 2014 and 2019 finals. Taking a look at how those previous championship matches went can give fans a clue at what to expect when these two meet for a record-extending 57th time. Each match in the Italian capital has been a highly competitive affair, with Nadal and Djokovic locked into lengthy battles, tie-breaks or deciding sets in each of their previous five finals.  This spells bad news for Djokovic, who reached the final after having to contest two matches on Saturday due to heavy rain interrupting his quarter-final against Stefanos Tsitsipas. The final two sets alone of his 4-6, 7-5, 7-5 victory over the Greek each clocked in at over an hour (1hr 5min and 1hr 22min, respectively), but the job wasn’t done yet. Djokovic took the court a few hours later against Lorenzo Sonego, and needed nearly three hours to move past the Italian (2hr 44mins) after he saved match points in the second set, 6-3, 6-7(5), 6-2.   “I'm very proud of what I have achieved today,” Djokovic said. “It was a very long day. [I] spent five hours almost on the court. [I] dug myself out of a very difficult situation versus Tsitsipas. He was so close to winning it. Somehow I managed to turn it around… I thought I played even on a higher level against Sonego.”  Djokovic will be aiming for a strong start and an early lead against Nadal on Sunday, as he knows better than anyone how dangerous it can be to give the Spaniard any kind of an advantage on the red clay. By contrast, Nadal spent just over an hour and a half on court on Saturday in his semi-final against big-serving Reilly Opelka, breaking once in each set of his 6-4, 6-4 victory.  “I think I played the match that I had to play… I had two breaks, two sets. That's a positive thing for me,” Nadal acknowledged in his post-match press conference. “[To] be in the final again here means a lot to me.  “I have been playing better, worse, but always [trending] in a positive line. I am playing better when the weeks are coming. Here, I had a very tough draw and I was able to find a way to be in the final.” Although their experiences on semi-final Saturday could not have been more different, 34-year-old Nadal and 33-year-old Djokovic’s paths to becoming the oldest Rome finalists in the Open Era have been eerily parallel.  Both players were tested by #NextGenATP stars and talented young players in the early rounds, with Nadal taking down 19-year-old Jannik Sinner 7-5, 6-4 in his opener and having to save match points to move past Denis Shapovalov 3-6, 6-4, 7-6(3). Djokovic overcame a stern test against Taylor Fritz 6-3, 7-6(5) before cruising past 21-year-old Alejandro Davidovich Fokina 6-2, 6-1.   They then had to contend against established stars and Masters 1000 champions in the quarter-finals – Djokovic against Tsitsipas, and Nadal against Alexander Zverev – before finding a way past surprise semi-finalists Sonego and Opelka. But whether rain or shine, #NextGenATP stars or Top 10 heavyweights – no matter what Rome threw their way, Djokovic and Nadal were once again left standing at the end of it all in the Eternal City.  “Rafa and I had a little laugh today in the locker room after I won against Tsitsipas,” Djokovic revealed. “We kind of joked around that the old guys are still not giving up. I saw [that] he said somewhere a few days ago that Roger, him and I are old, but I disagree with him. I think we're showing some different, fresh energy.  “We had a laugh about it… I'm really glad that we are showing we're not backing off from the #NextGenATP attacks.” Novak Djokovic (36) and Rafael Nadal (35) lead all players in ATP Masters 1000 championships. They also boast the most on clay courts, with Nadal owning 25 titles and Djokovic 10. They are both seeking their first Masters 1000 title of the year in Rome.",Rafael Nadal won Rome in 2021.
Who won Toronto in 2021?,"If coach Gilles Cervara has one piece of advice for Daniil Medvedev heading into Sunday's Toronto final against Reilly Opelka, it's likely this: Rinse & Repeat.  After a returning masterclass Saturday night in a 6-2, 6-2 win against 6'10"" American John Isner, the Russian will be looking to blunt the booming serve of 6'11"" Opelka in the National Bank Open Presented by Rogers championship match.  And the key tactic will likely be the same. Medvedev, who normally chooses to stand close to the back wall to return, stood two to three feet closer to the baseline against Isner to counter the angle and height the American can get on his serve. The approach paid off big time! The top seed put a stunning 84 per cent of Isner's serves back into play and won 50 per cent of return points – unheard of numbers for an Isner opponent.  If Medvedev can produce similar stats against Opelka, he'll be well on his way to leaving Canada with his fourth ATP Masters 1000 title. He hinted in his on-court interview last night that he won’t be be tinkering too much with the winning formula Sunday. ""With serves like John or Reilly you cannot stand too far back because the ball is not going to come down, it will just go higher and higher,” Medvedev said. “So I tried to return a bit closer than I am used to and it worked pretty well. I'm not sure how it will go tomorrow, but at least it was a good practice to get ready for the same thing.”  Medvedev, who rallied from a set down against Alexander Bublik in his opening match and against Hubert Hurkacz in the quarter-finals, is steeling himself for another battle Sunday.  ""Reilly is a player who can cause problems to everybody,"" Medvedev added. ""You saw that today against Stefanos, who had been in very good form this tournament. He didn't even break him and maybe only had one opportunity in three sets. Reilly has been playing really well from the baseline all week with good backhands down the line. I'm looking forward to the match."" In 2021 Opelka has shown that a player can achieve a lot by winning matches at the right time.  The American has won consecutive matches at just three of the 15 tournaments he has played this year. But his runs to the Rome semi-finals, Roland Garros third round and now his maiden Masters 1000 final in Toronto final will take him to inside the Top 30 of the FedEx ATP Rankings for the first time on Monday.  Opelka has earned his place in the final the hard way, rallying from a set down in the first round to beat Nick Kyrgios, taking out former World No. 3 Grigor Dimitrov in the second round and saving a match point against Lloyd Harris in the third round. He beat former World No. 9 Roberto Bautista Agut in the quarter-finals and rallied from a set down against third seed Stefanos Tsitsipas in Saturday’s semi-finals.  Opelka was in a serious funk mid-season when he entered the Internazionali BNL d'Italia on a six-match losing streak. But his run to his first Masters 1000 semi-final in Rome (l. Nadal) was a massive confidence booster, which was soon followed by a third-round showing at Roland Garros (l. Medvedev).  Although Medvedev enjoyed a straight-sets win in Paris this year, Opelka has caused him problems in their three career hard-court meetings. In 2020, the American surprised Medvedev on home soil at St. Petersburg, saving seven of nine break points in a 2-6, 7-5, 6-4 win. In their first two meetings, Medvedev needed a third-set tie-break in Miami in 2019 (when neither player broke serve) and in Washington in 2017 (when Opelka was broken three times) to win.  Opelka said after his semi-final win over Tsitsipas that he had improved his composure on court, something which may be tested against Medvedev.  “Just like any human, I'll show some frustration, but it's something I have worked a lot on, and it's just required in order to beat the best guys,"" he said. ""You don't have time, I have learned, to waste energy on other things, and your mind has to be engaged on one thing only.”  And that one thing in Sunday’s final will be finding a way to disrupt Medvedev’s rhythm on return.",Daniil Medvedev won Toronto in 2021.
Who won Cincinnati in 2021?,"History is relentless – and, ultimately, undefeated – but as Andrey Rublev discovered Saturday afternoon in Mason, Ohio, sometimes it can be re-written by those bold enough to challenge what has passed before.  Coming into his Western & Southern Open semi-final with fellow Russian Daniil Medvedev, the 23-year-old had lost each of the four ATP-level matches between them – and all 10 sets. When the No.1 seed took the first set rather easily, it looked like more of the same.  But Rublev rallied famously and, perhaps helped by a jarring Medvedev collision with a television camera, dramatically altered the narrative with a 2-6, 6-3, 6-3 victory.  He’ll face Alexander Zverev – himself a dramatic 6-4, 3-6, 7-6 (4) winner over Stefanos Tsitsipas – in a delectable Sunday final (4:30 p.m., ET). The gold medallist at the Tokyo Olympics was down a double break at 1-4 in the third set and, despite suffering severe gastric distress, managed a remarkable comeback to extend his winning streak to 10 matches. What would it mean to Rublev to win his first Masters 1000 event?  “Of course it will be special, and especially this place that I have such great memories that many things happen here that help me also and change a bit myself,” Rublev said in his post-match press conference. “But we’ll see. I’m not thinking this way.  “This week was already, is amazing for me. It’s one more amazing memory in my head. I’m going to do my best tomorrow, and that’s all I can say.”  Rublev will have yet another opportunity to re-write his personal history.  The No.3-seeded Zverev, like Medvedev coming into the semi-finals, leads the ATP Head2Head 4-0 (and 9-0 in sets), with the most recent victory coming in the fourth round of the Australian Open, 6-4, 6-4, 6-4.  “Yeah, he’s playing the tennis of his life, I think beating Daniil, who is in incredible form right now,” Zverev said of Rublev. “It’s going to be of course a tough one, but also a fun one. I have known Andrey since we were 11 years old.  “We have been pretty much best friends for a long period of time. It’s great to see how long of a way we came and that we are kind of playing the biggest matches and competing for the biggest titles together.” Medvedev was attempting to accomplish the rare Canada/Cincinnati double and playing his 13th match in less than one month. He reached the quarter-finals at the Tokyo Olympics, losing to Pablo Carreno Busta, and then won the title in Toronto.  In the third game of the second set, however, Medvedev ran into a television camera while chasing a sharply angled ball from Rublev. It was a violent crash; the heavy camera actually came off its mooring. Medvedev required a medical timeout and never recaptured the momentum of the first set.  “I think it’s, how you say, tough situation,” Rublev said. “When you run far away, you can hit some, or referee sometimes or chair that stay next to you. Here happens that Daniil, he hit camera. Of course in these moments it’s really dangerous because something can happen.” Against Zverev, Rublev will have to channel the poise and precision he showed in the eighth game of the second set. With Medvedev serving at 3-4, Rublev prevailed in a 22-point game that required 15 minutes. It was the kind of game the patient, counter-punching Medvedev usually won in their previous encounters.  “In that moment, I feel that was like the turning point for both of us, because was so humid and so hot,” Rublev said. “That game we play so many great rallies, long rallies. I could feel that Daniil was a bit already tired, because sometimes he was doing mistakes that normally he was not doing.”  Zverev, who defeated Novak Djokovic in the Olympic semi-finals and Karen Khachanov in final, lost to Tsitsipas in the semi-finals at Roland Garros. He came back from that 1-4 deficit in the third set with some superb serving. There were three aces and four unreturnable offerings at 5-all and in the tie-break Zverev unleashed back-to-back serves at 131 and 133 miles per hour to position himself for the victory.  The four young Cincinnati semi-finalists seem to be in the best position to challenge No. 1 Novak Djokovic’s bid to score a Grand Slam and break the three-way tie with Federer and Nadal for most major titles.  Medvedev, at 25, is the oldest of the group, followed by Zverev (24), Rublev and Tsitsipas, who are both 23. This was the first time in nine years the top four seeds all reached the final four of a Masters 1000. That happened in Shanghai, China and, for the record, those players were Roger Federer, Djokovic, Andy Murray and Tomas Berdych. With Federer, Djokovic and Nadal all missing in action Saturday – the 40-year-old Federer and Nadal (35) say they are done for the year – this is, going forward, what elite men’s tennis might look like.  Consider the list of ATP leaders in match wins for 2021: Tsitsipas (48), Rublev (41), Medvedev (40), Casper Ruud (39) and Djokovic (38). Zverev and Cameron Norrie are next with 37.  “It was a very dramatic match against one of the best players in the world this year,” Zverev said. “I think Stef has been playing incredible tennis and is on an incredible level. I think it was very entertaining for all the people, but it was also entertaining to play it itself, because I went through a lot of emotions.  “I mean, first, I was winning, I was playing incredible tennis. Then I had some physical issues. Then I had to come back. I had to dig deep. To come back, to win that match, is a great feeling.”",Alexander Zverev won Cincinnati in 2021.
Who won Paris in 2021?,"Novak Djokovic and Daniil Medvedev are poised for a blockbuster meeting Sunday at the Rolex Paris Masters, where the World’s No. 1 and No. 2 players clash in the final for just the second time in tournament history.  “Let's hope for the sake of the fans and everyone involved we can have a thrilling match,” Djokovic said. “I look forward to that challenge.”  Having clinched the year-end No. 1 FedEx ATP Ranking for a record seventh time on Saturday, Djokovic turns his attention to capturing a sixth title in Bercy and breaking his tie with Rafael Nadal for most Masters 1000 titles (36). Avenging this year’s US Open loss to the Russian would be icing on the cake. Defending champion Medvedev has the chance to do what no other player has achieved against Djokovic. Should he win and level their ATP Head2Head series at 5-5, the 25-year-old would become the first of 30 players who have played 10 or more matches against Djokovic to achieve a 50 per cent winning record against the 20-time Grand Slam champion.  Medvedev indicated that he will look to rinse and repeat his winning backhand-to-backhand battle from the US Open. The big question is how Djokovic will counter.  “Of course winning the US Open would give me maybe some tactical things I want to try to repeat or use against Novak,” Medvedev said. “At the same time, we all know who Novak is. If he would not adapt to circumstances, he would not be where he is now. So he's definitely going to try to change something.” At Flushing Meadows, Medvedev was happy to settle into extended crosscourt backhand exchanges with the Serb. Djokovic found it difficult to attack the Russian’s flat, skidding backhand and even more difficult to run around the stroke. Djokovic took 57 percent of his groundstrokes on his backhand wing and hit just one forehand winner from the Ad court.  Djokovic tallied just three forehand winners for the match to Medvedev’s 11. How successfully he upgrades from a backhand to a forehand on Sunday could prove telling in the outcome. “Last time we played, he overplayed me,” Djokovic said. “I overplayed him in the finals of the Australian Open. It was quite straightforward matches, both of them. Hopefully I'll be able to turn the tables around this time, learning from that experience in New York.  “I saw him play a little bit today against Zverev. He's been playing fantastic tennis… He's not missing much and serving big. It seems like he's finding the groove.” Djokovic, who dropped a set in his opening match to Marton Fucsovics and needed a third-set tie-break to beat Hubert Hurkacz in the semi-finals, has failed in just one of the past 10 seasons (2017) to win at least one Masters 1000 title. But today is his last chance to net his first of 2021.  Medvedev, who rallied from a set down in the third round to beat Sebastian Korda, is looking to close out 2021 in style by successfully defending titles in Paris and at the Nitto ATP Finals in Turin.  Since the start of the Rolex Paris Masters in 2020, Medvedev is 64-11 overall, 19-1 indoors and 14-3 against Top 10 competition. Of the 82 players to face Djokovic more than once as World No. 1, he is the only player with a winning record (4-2).  But the Russian is guarded when thinking that his US Open victory gives him an edge going into the final. “Against some players you feel like maybe you won a few months ago and you can gain confidence from this,” he said. “Against Novak you know that actually he is going to want to beat you even more when you beat him.”",Novak Djokovic won Paris in 2021.
Who won Rome in 2020?,"When Novak Djokovic and Diego Schwartzman meet for the fifth time in their ATP Head2Head series (Djokovic leads 4-0) in Monday’s Internazionali BNL d’Italia final, both players will not only be fighting for the Rome trophy, but also a personal milestone.  Following the completion of his second Career Golden Masters at the Western & Southern Open last month, Djokovic is the joint Masters 1000 titles leader alongside fellow 35-time champion Rafael Nadal. The Rome final presents Djokovic with an opportunity to overtake his rival by lifting a 36th trophy at the level. On the other side of the net, Schwartzman is one win away from cracking the Top 10 in the FedEx ATP Rankings for the first time in his career. The Argentine can achieve the feat by defeating Djokovic for the first time to claim his maiden Masters 1000 trophy.  Djokovic has dropped just one set en route to his 10th final in the Italian capital, improving his match record to 30-1 this year. The 33-year-old has been tested throughout the week in each of his three most recent clashes in Rome. Djokovic played an 87-minute set against Filip Krajinovic in the third round, survived a three-set quarter-final battle against Dominik Koepfer and saved two set points in the first set of his semi-final clash against Casper Ruud. The Serbian has consistently produced his best level under pressure to close in on a fifth trophy at the Foro Italico.  Djokovic’s victory against Ruud improved his semi-final record in Rome to 10-1, but the Serbian has not fared as well in championship matches at the Masters 1000 event. Djokovic owns a 4-5 record in Rome finals, which includes losses in his past three championship matches (2016-’17, ’19). An opportunity to overtake Nadal and make further history in Rome are huge motivational factors for the World No. 1. The four-time champion is still as ambitious as he was the first time he arrived at the tournament, where he has enjoyed consistent success since 2007. Djokovic has reached the quarter-finals or better in each of his 14 appearances at the Foro Italico.  “The 1000 Masters events are as important as it gets on the Tour,” said Djokovic. “These are the events where I want to perform my best other than Grand Slams and the [Nitto ATP Finals]… Finals at such big events mean a lot even after 15 years [of] being on the Tour. I still am as motivated to get my hands on the trophy. This is what I work for as much as anybody else, really, on the Tour.”  Standing between Djokovic and the Masters 1000 titles record is a first-time finalist at the level: Diego Schwartzman. Djokovic enters the contest with a 4-0 ATP Head2Head record against the 28-year-old, but will be well aware of the threat the Argentine poses. The pair met in the semi-finals at this event last year, with Djokovic eventually prevailing in three sets after two hours and 31 minutes. Djokovic will face an opponent with peak confidence levels on Centrale. Schwartzman dropped just one set en route to the quarter-finals, where he earned his first victory in 10 matches against nine-time champion Rafael Nadal. Schwartzman described the straight-sets win as his “best match ever” and his final opponent was equally impressed.  “Diego played the match of his life [against Nadal]… He was so impressive,” said Djokovic. “And that proves that anything is possible, even [against] Nadal who is probably the toughest challenge in our sport, playing Nadal on clay. But he managed to win in straight sets, so that proves his quality.”  The opportunity to enter the Top 10 for the first time and lift the biggest title of his career with a single victory perhaps makes Monday’s final the biggest match of Schwartzman’s career. The World No. 15 is prepared to push himself to the limit to realise two dreams at the Masters 1000 tournament. “I have two dreams tomorrow. One is winning a tournament like this and the second one: be Top 10,” said Schwartzman. “Both are there tomorrow on court against Novak. I know it's very difficult. I almost need to play more than my 100 per cent.  “I don't want to say impossible, because it's not impossible. I know can beat him. But it's going to be very difficult. But the chances are there tomorrow… I'm going to do everything to be more than my 100 per cent tomorrow on court.”  After his victory against Nadal, Schwartzman was able to maintain his level and earn another milestone win just 24 hours later on Centrale. The Argentine trailed by a break on three occasions in the deciding set of his semi-final clash against Denis Shapovalov, but fought back to claim a memorable final-set tie-break win after three hours and 15 minutes. “At the end, maybe the third set we were playing for many things: for the final, for the Top 10, for the match… The nerves were there. It was difficult,” said Schwartzman.  “But I think I took my chances when he was thinking about [the] win and nothing else, when he was serving for the match and [a] break up in the third.”  Having already ended a winless streak against Nadal, Schwartzman will now attempt to do the same against Djokovic. The rewards for victory in Rome are clear to both men. But who will be able to take their chance on Monday and place their name in the history books?",Novak Djokovic won Rome in 2020.
Who won Cincinnati in 2020?,"Novak Djokovic is one win from completing an unprecedented second Career Golden Masters. Will former World No. 3 Milos Raonic be able to stop him?  That’s the big question heading into the Western & Southern Open final, which will decide the first ATP Tour champion since play was suspended due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Djokovic became the first player to win all nine ATP Masters 1000 titles two years ago in Cincinnati, and he will try to complete the feat for a second time on Saturday.  The Career Golden Masters is an incredible achievement, showing mastery at the highest level on both hard and clay, outdoors and indoors (Paris). Nobody else has accomplished it once, and the Serbian is on the verge of duplicating his feat. If Djokovic wins, he will also tie Rafael Nadal for the most Masters 1000 titles with 35. The World No. 1 will take confidence knowing he leads the pair’s ATP Head2Head series 10-0. But the Serbian knows he will need to bring his best at the USTA Billie Jean King National Tennis Center.  ""[He has a] huge serve,"" Djokovic said of Raonic, who has hit a tournament-leading 88 aces. ""He's playing well, he's confident and let's hope for a good final."" Djokovic needed three hours and one minute on Friday (the longest match of the tournament) against rock-solid Roberto Bautista Agut to reach the final. The Serbian will have to quickly adjust his game against Raonic, though.  The Canadian will not grind through long baseline rallies like Bautista Agut did. He will attempt to overpower the top seed with his massive serve and attack the first ball of each rally. That will make the serve and return critical. Raonic has won 55 of his 57 service games this week (96%) and he leads the tournament in first-serve points won (86%). The World No. 30 will try to make history of his own, as he can become the first Canadian to win an ATP Masters 1000 title. The 29-year-old, who hasn’t tasted ATP Tour glory since 2016 Brisbane, is into his fourth championship match at this level. He will try to become the first unseeded player to lift the trophy in the Open Era (0-11). “I'm playing well. I think I'm moving much better than I definitely have in recent years. Maybe it's been a long time [off], and I think that's putting me in a better position so I'm able to be more effective and more aggressive earlier [in rallies],” Raonic said. “I'm able to play more on my terms and quicker on in the points.” Although Raonic didn’t say so during his post-match press conference, the better match-up for him would have been against Bautista Agut. The Canadian has won all five of his ATP Head2Head matches against the Spaniard, whereas Djokovic has clinched eight of his 10 clashes against Raonic in straight sets.  Djokovic has been suffocating on return this event, winning 41 per cent of his return games to lead all players. His quarter-final opponent, Jan-Lennard Struff, is closer to Raonic’s playing style than Bautista Agut. Djokovic broke the big-hitting German five times, neutralising all of his attacks in a 62-minute victory. The top seed is trying to become the first World No. 1 to win the Western & Southern Open since Roger Federer beat him in 2012. But Raonic is playing tennis reminiscent of his days inside the Top 5. Will that be enough? Djokovic is appearing in his seventh Western & Souther Open final (1-5), which is tied for the second-most in tournament history with Bill Talbert. Only Roger Federer (8) has reached more championship matches at this event.",Novak Djokovic won Cincinnati in 2020.
Who won Paris in 2020?,"Daniil Medvedev last reached a championship match on the ATP Tour 13 months ago, but the 24-year-old will likely feel a sense of familiarity when he steps onto the court Sunday to compete for the Rolex Paris Masters title.  The last final Medvedev played was also at an ATP Masters 1000 event: the 2019 Rolex Shanghai Masters. The Russian succeeded on that occasion with a straight-sets victory against Alexander Zverev. The same man stands between him and this year’s Paris trophy.  Medvedev arrived in the French capital searching for form after losing five of his past eight matches. But the two-time Masters 1000 champion has raised his game at the Accor Arena to end his final drought. Medvedev has conceded only one set in Paris, with wins against Kevin Anderson, Alex de Minaur, Diego Schwartzman and Milos Raonic.  When Medvedev met Zverev in last year’s Shanghai final, he was competing in a Tour-leading ninth final of the year. But despite this being his first run to a championship match in 2020, one of Medvedev’s rivals in Paris believes he might actually be playing better this year than during his breakthrough 2019 campaign.  “I think he's playing just as well, maybe better,” said Raonic. “Just little things, the intangibles of confidence, maybe it makes a little bit of a difference here and there. But from what I have seen him play this week and [he] even played well at the US Open, played well [at the Western & Southern Open]…… all the events he's played on hard courts, I thought he's looked quite good.” Medvedev will be competing in his fourth Masters 1000 final when he meets Zverev in Paris. The Moscow-native holds a 2-1 record in championship matches at the level, which includes victories in his past two final appearances. Prior to his title runs at the 2019 Western & Southern Open and Rolex Shanghai Masters, Medvedev finished as a runner-up to Rafael Nadal at last year’s Coupe Rogers in Montreal.  “Experience is a good key,” said Medvedev. “The first Masters [1000] final I lost actually very easy to Rafa, and then I won two… When you step out for your first Masters 1000 final, you are really tight, your hands are shaking a little bit because you think, ‘Okay, maybe that's my last opportunity to be in the final of a Masters 1000.’ Then [the] second, third time, the more you get [to] them, the more it becomes easier to handle these emotions. So hopefully this experience can help me tomorrow.”  Medvedev may have experience and memories of defeating his Paris final opponent at this stage, but Zverev has an even greater understanding of competing in this environment. The German will be making his seventh Masters 1000 final appearance (3-3) and will be aiming to improve his 5-1 ATP Head2Head record against his Russian rival. Prior to his loss to Medvedev in last year’s Shanghai final, Zverev had dropped just one set in four meetings against the crafty baseliner. The 2018 Nitto ATP Finals champion also added a fifth victory against Medvedev to his tally at The O2 last year.  Zverev enters the Paris final in peak form. The 13-time tour-level titlist is on a 12-match winning streak, which includes back-to-back title runs at indoor hard court events in Cologne last month. Like his final opponent, Zverev has also dropped just one set en route to the final in Paris. Zverev made it through to the semi-finals with wins against Miomir Kecmanovic, Adrian Mannarino and Stan Wawrinka, before he ended 13-time Roland Garros champion Rafael Nadal’s winning run in Paris on Saturday.  Medvedev is back to his best and has risen to this challenge before, but this time he faces Zverev in one of the most consistent periods of the German’s career. Both men know what it takes to beat the other and to succeed at this level, but only one player can lift his first Paris trophy on Sunday.  “Obviously, [the] two best players of the tournament are still left. I'm happy about it,” said Zverev. “I think [Daniil is] quite happy about it. We're both not going to give each other anything tomorrow and we'll see who can win.”",Daniil Medvedev won Paris in 2020.
Who won Indian Wells in 2019?,"Five-time BNP Paribas Open champion Roger Federer may not have had to step on the court against second seed Rafael Nadal on Saturday, as the Spaniard withdrew from the tournament due to right knee pain. But nevertheless, Federer is on the verge of history in Indian Wells, one match away from becoming the first player to capture six titles in the California desert.  Federer, who is tied with World No. 1 Novak Djokovic at five Indian Wells crowns, will not have it easy in the final against seventh seed Dominic Thiem, who seeks his first ATP Masters 1000 title. This will be the pair’s fifth FedEx ATP Head2Head clash, with each player winning two of their previous meetings. Federer has triumphed in both of their hard court matches.  “I'm just excited to be in another finals here, to be quite honest,” said Federer, who is into his ninth Indian Wells final. “It's not the way I wanted to get there in a semi-finals walkover, but as we know, it's how it goes sometimes in tennis.” Federer has flown through the draw thus far at the first Masters 1000 event of the year, winning all eight sets he has played. The 37-year-old has been broken only once in the tournament, and that came in the second set of his opening-round victory against German Peter Gojowczyk.  Federer, who by triumphing in Dubai earlier this month became the second player in the Open Era to win 100 tour-level titles, is in position to erase bad memories from last year in Indian Wells, where he missed out on three championship points before losing to Juan Martin del Potro in the final.  “I hope I can play a great match. It’s a big tournament, big final for me tomorrow especially after last year’s tough loss against Juan Martin,” Federer said. “I would love to go all the way this year, we’ll see how it goes.”  Across the net will be a hungry Austrian in Thiem. The 25-year-old carries plenty of confidence into the match after his two-hour, 31-minute three-set win in the semi-finals against Milos Raonic. The World No. 8 had not lost a set before dropping the middle set against the Canadian. But he is ready to push for a Masters 1000 breakthrough on Sunday. “I think he’s playing very well. I think he’s using the kick serve very effectively. The spins, they really bounce up high here in the desert air. I think he’s one of the fittest guys out there and can hit the ball the hardest. I think this surface suits him well for that,” Federer said. “I really hope I can play aggressive tennis against him. But I like his style. He uses the spins and the variations very effectively and for that I think we’ll see some interesting points tomorrow.”  Before this tournament, Thiem, a two-time Mutua Madrid Open finalist, had made the semi-finals of a Masters 1000 event on hard courts just once. Coincidentally, that was the most recent tournament at this level: the 2018 Rolex Paris Masters. He has only advanced to the quarter-finals in Indian Wells once, and owns just one win against a Top 10 opponent on the surface (1-10) compared to his eight on clay (8-10). But he feels comfortable on the courts at the BNP Paribas Open, which he believes are similar to those at the US Open, where he pushed Nadal to a fifth-set tie-break in the quarter-finals.  ""I was preparing here for 12 days before the tournament. That helped, of course, a lot. This surface and also the one in New York, for example, it suits me pretty well because it's bouncy, especially during the day,"" Thiem said. ""It's not too fast, so it's a little bit more similar to a clay court. The biggest adjustment is the moving, that I cannot slide around.""   Thiem has done a little bit of everything this tournament, from standing against the flowerbeds at the back of the court to return Raonic's serves, to stepping up to the baseline to take gargantuan rips at his groundstrokes. One thing's for sure — he's going to try to use every tool in his arsenal to prevent Federer from lifting his 28th Masters 1000 title.  ""It's always something special to play him and also something special to compete in a Masters 1000 final. It's only my third one,"" Thiem said. ""I know it's going to be very tough, but same time, I will give everything to hopefully win my first title."" This will be Federer's 153rd tour-level final, but his first against an Austrian. Federer holds a 10-4 record against Austrians, losing one match apiece against Stefan Koubek (2001 Vienna) and Jurgen Melzer (2011 Monte-Carlo).",Dominic Thiem won Indian Wells in 2019.
Who won Miami in 2019?,"Fourth seed Roger Federer and seventh seed John Isner face off for the first time in four years in Sunday’s final at the Miami Open presented by Itau. Federer leads their FedEx ATP Head2Head series 5-2, but given the trajectory of their careers since their last battle at the 2015 Rolex Paris Masters, won by Isner in a third-set tie-break, they will arrive on Stadium Court with a clean slate.  Since that match, Isner has earned a career-high ATP Ranking of No. 8 (in July 2018), reached his first Grand Slam semi-final (2018 Wimbledon) and picked up his first ATP Masters 1000 title last year in Miami (d. Zverev). He’s now one match away from a successful title defence after powering into the final without dropping a set.  After undergoing knee surgery in 2016 and taking the second half of that season off to recover from it, some critics wondered whether Federer would get back to the top of the game. He’s silenced them all by winning 12 more ATP Tour titles, including three Grand Slams, three Masters 1000 titles and his 100th tour-level title earlier this month at the Dubai Duty Free Tennis Championships (d. Tsitsipas). After surviving an opening-round scare in Miami against Radu Albot of Moldova, he’s dropped an average of six games in his past five matches. There will be no secrets when Federer and Isner meet. It’s one of the best serves of all time against one of the best returns of all time. Almost all of their matches have been highly competitive affairs and Sunday's clash should be no exception.  “He's definitely got one of the serves that you basically can’t read. It's that simple,” said Federer. “You just hope that the stars align, that you pick the right side, he picks the wrong side, maybe he misses a serve, that you can put him in uncomfortable situations time and time again, and at the end somehow find a way.”  Familiarity with the moment could play a factor. Federer is playing in his 50th Masters 1000 final (27-22), while Isner is competing in his fifth (1-3). It will be important for Federer to get off to a hot start as he’s done in his past two matches against Kevin Anderson and Denis Shapovalov. If he can grab an early break, Federer will establish that that he can run away with the momentum. Isner has been the tie-break king in Miami, winning nine of his 10 sets this fortnight with a 7-6 scoreline. His tie-break record against Federer is impressive, but less dominant at 4-4. Isner will need to take care of his service games and continue to keep the scoreline close. The deeper a set goes, the more the odds will favour him.  The American downplayed his chances at defending his crown at the start of the tournament, but his low-key approach didn’t reflect his unwavering confidence that he could. While some fans may be surprised to see him produce another inspired run, Isner is not and believes he has the tools to leave Miami with back-to-back titles.  “I believe personally that I can win any tournament I enter because of how disruptive I can be and because of how well I can serve at times,” said Isner. “I'm not surprised that I'm sitting here back in the final again.”  Saturday's doubles final will see third seeds Bob Bryan and Mike Bryan pursue a sixth doubles title in Miami. The Americans take on Dutchman Wesley Koolhof and Stefanos Tsitsipas of Greece. Koolhof is playing in his first Masters 1000 final and Tsitsipas is competing in his first ATP Tour doubles final.",Roger Federer won Miami in 2019.
Who won Monte Carlo in 2019?,"Fabio Fognini and Dusan Lajovic wrap up a wild week on Sunday at the Rolex Monte-Carlo Masters as both men battle for their first ATP Masters 1000 title. This is the first time that Monte-Carlo has featured two first-time Masters 1000 finalists since the Masters 1000 series began in 1990.  Fognini, seeded 13th, is competing in his first Masters 1000 singles final. He sent shockwaves through the tennis world with his semi-final upset of 11-time Monte-Carlo champion Rafael Nadal. Fognini won nine of the last 11 games and fired winners at will to hand the Spaniard one of the most one-sided losses of his career on clay. Read More The Italian’s current level is even more surprising given his form throughout the season. Fognini had a 4-8 record at the start of the week and arrived in Monte-Carlo having won just one of his past eight matches. He was down a set and 1-4 in his first-round match against Russian qualifier Andrey Rublev, but found a way to prevail and has continued to raise his level with each match.  ""If you told me at the beginning of the week, I will see you on Sunday, I would [have] laughed in your face,"" said Fognini. ""I was 6-4, 4-1 down and break point for 5-1, and I [hit an] ace on the line. But that's sport. So I was lucky. Now I'm in the final. And of course I go for the title tomorrow.""  Although Fognini has at times lost his concentration this tournament, he's been able to regroup for incredible comeback wins. In addition to his victory over Rublev, he rallied from 1-6, 0-2 to defeat ninth seed Borna Coric of Croatia in the quarter-finals.   Lajovic looks to become the first man to win his first ATP Tour title at a Masters 1000 title event since Albert Portas (Hamburg 2001). The World No. 48 in the ATP Rankings hasn’t dropped drop a set this week and is the lowest-ranked Monte-Carlo finalist since Hicham Arazi in 2001. He had never reached an ATP Tour final before this week, but has been unfazed in handling the new occasions he’s found himself in. Not even a blister on Lajovic’s toe has been able to stop his flawless all-court play. Although he acknowledged feeling discomfort with it, the Serbian is adamant that he won’t allow it to affect him in Sunday’s final.  “It’s pain every day. It takes a while to get ready to go on court,” said Lajovic. “I’m going to cut that toe off if it means I can play tomorrow.”  The doubles final features Dutch pair Wesley Koolhof and Robin Haase taking on seventh seeds Nikola Mektic and Franko Skugor of Croatia. Mektic has won two Masters 1000 titles in the past 12 months (2018 Mutua Madrid Open w/Peya, 2019 BNP Paribas Open w/Zeballos). Skugor, Koolhof and Haase all seek their first title at this level. If Fognini wins the title, he will:  + Become the first Italian to win a Masters 1000 title, since the series debuted in 1990. He is already the first finalist from his country.;  + Rise to a career-high in the ATP Rankings at No. 12  + Become the first player to beat Rafael Nadal en route to a clay-court title since Pablo Cuevas in Rio de Janeiro in 2016  If Lajovic wins the title, he will:  + Become the first unseeded player to win in Monte-Carlo since Thomas Muster in 1992  + Become the first player to win his maiden ATP Tour title at a Masters 1000 event since Albert Portas in Hamburg in 2001  + Crack the Top 20 of the ATP Rankings for the first time, rising to a career-high No. 19  + Will join Novak Djokovic as the only Serbians to win a Masters 1000 singles title",Fabio Fognini won Monte Carlo in 2019.
Who won Madrid in 2019?,"Top seed Novak Djokovic and eighth seed Stefanos Tsitsipas face off in a battle of experience against youth on Sunday in the Mutua Madrid Open final. Djokovic seeks his third title in Madrid and 33rd ATP Masters 1000 title overall, while Tsitsipas looks to lift his first Masters 1000 crown. The Serbian can also tie Rafael Nadal's record for most Masters 1000 titles (33) with a win on Sunday.  After struggling for form since capturing the Australian Open trophy in January (d. Nadal), Djokovic has produced his best tennis once again in Madrid. The World No. 1 hasn’t dropped a set this week and defeated arguably the most in-form clay-court player this season in fifth seed Dominic Thiem to reach the final. Djokovic will have familiarity with the occasion on his side in Sunday’s final. He’s competing in his 48th Masters 1000 final (32-15) compared to just two for Tsitsipas (0-1). The Serbian is 2-0 in Madrid finals, defeating Nadal in 2011 and Andy Murray in 2016. Although he’s the on-paper favourite, Djokovic knows better than to take his opponent lightly. The 2018 Next Gen ATP Finals champion won their only previous FedEx ATP Head2Head meeting last August at the Rogers Cup en route to his maiden Masters 1000 final (l. to Nadal).  “He’s not an easy opponent to play against. He's in form and a young player who is already Top 10 [in the ATP Rankings],” said Djokovic. “Hopefully I can be at my best because that is what is going to be needed to win.” Tsitsipas is enjoying an incredible run in Madrid. The 20-year-old took out third seed and defending champion Alexander Zverev in the quarter-finals before stunning five-time champion Nadal in a three-set thriller. Tsitsipas showed outstanding court coverage and creativity in his shotmaking to defeat a player inside the Top 2 of the ATP Rankings for the first time in his career, but the Greek knows that Djokovic will pose a much different test to what he faced last year in Toronto.  “I have never faced him on clay, so I don't know what to expect. I have seen plenty of his matches, but I'm going to try to adapt to the way he is playing on clay as fast as I can because I'm pretty sure he is not easy on clay,” said Tsitsipas. “I’m going to have to be mentally focused and also psychologically ready for a fight. That will be very important in tomorrow's match.”  Tsitsipas was ranked No. 40 in the ATP Rankings at this time last year and had to go through the qualifying draw in Rome. His rapid ascension since then includes his first three ATP Tour titles in Stockholm 2018 (d. Gulbis), Marseille 2019 (d. Kukushkin) and Estoril 2019 (d. Cuevas). He’s also reached his first Masters 1000 final in Toronto and first Grand Slam semi-final at the Australian Open. Tsitsipas is guaranteed to hit a career-high ATP Ranking of at least No. 7 on Monday, pending Sunday’s championship result.  With all the milestone firsts he’s been experiencing, Tsitsipas is confident he can add one more by taking his first Masters 1000 title.  “I'm more experienced [than last year], more fit and experience plays a huge role in the way you are going to play,” said Tsitsipas. “And more courageous. [I am] a more courageous Stefanos with more guts and mentally much tougher than I was the year before.”",Novak Djokovic won Madrid in 2019.
Who won Toronto in 2019?,"Forget the “King of Clay”, a nickname that doesn't truly reflect Rafael Nadal's mastery of all surfaces during his legendary ATP Tour career. How about “King of Masters”?  Nadal already owns the most ATP Masters 1000 wins in the series' 30-year history, 380, two better than longtime rival Roger Federer. The Spaniard advanced to his 51st final at the elite level, one better than Federer's 50, on Saturday when Gael Monfils withdrew (ankle) from their Coupe Rogers semi-final.  Should Nadal beat Russian Daniil Medvedev in the Montreal final on Sunday, the World No. 2 would win his 35th Masters 1000 crown, extending his all-time lead. Novak Djokovic has the second-most Masters 1000 tites, with 33.  King of Masters, indeed.  But a recounting of Nadal's pedigree won't tremble Medvedev, who's into his first Masters 1000 final and has won eight of his past nine matches. “I won't be intimidated. I want to win every match I play,” he said.  The World No. 9 has hardly been bothered all week in the French-speaking Canadian city. Medvedev, who trains in France, is sponsored by Lacoste, has a French coach (Gilles Cervara) and speaks French, has been playing as if he's on home courts and has been embraced as one of Montreal's own.  “After the match, everybody says, 'Oh, you speak French, Daniil'. I think this brings the crowd to support me. It's funny,” he said. The 23-year-old had reached only one Masters 1000 semi-final before this week, in April at the clay-court Rolex Monte-Carlo Masters (l. to Lajovic). But hard courts, where his flat backhand can do the most damage, have long been his favourite surface. Medvedev has won all four of his ATP Tour titles on hard court and owns his best winning percentage (66%) of the three surfaces on it.  The Russian, however, has never had a week like this at a Masters 1000 event. Following his run to the Citi Open final last week (l. to Kyrgios), Medvedev dropped only three games against Brit Kyle Edmund, swept two-time ATP Tour titlist Cristian Garin of Chile 6-3, 6-3 and delivered his best show yet against No. 4 Dominic Thiem, dropping only four games.  In the semi-finals against longtime friend Karen Khachanov, Medvedev tightened up serving for the match at 5-4, but he held on to win in straight sets and improve to 8-0 in sets this week.  “It just means that I'm playing better now, that I'm able to beat these top players in two sets. It's a great achievement,” Medvedev said.   Nadal's only blemish came in his quarter-final against Italy's Fabio Fognini, but the top seed and defending champion quickly erased those memories, dropping only three games in the final two sets.  “In general terms [it was] an up-and-down match, but a positive match for me because I played better and better,” Nadal said.  He and Medvedev have never met, marking the second time this season a Masters 1000 final will be the first meeting between the two finalists (Monte-Carlo, Fognini v Lajovic). If Medvedev can get off to his customary fast start, give the Russian a chance, even against the all-time Masters 1000 titles leader.  Nadal, perhaps more so than others, really arrives at top gear after a break of serve, and if Medvedev can keep holding, make yourself comfortable, because the Russian is not lacking belief.  “I'm playing very well right now,” he said. “I believe if I am able to play like this, it's not going to be easy for Rafa. It's going to be a big battle.”",Rafael Nadal won Toronto in 2019.
Who won Cincinnati in 2019?,"Few predicted a Western & Southern Open final between Russian Daniil Medvedev and Belgian David Goffin. But that matters little to the players, who each has a tremendous opportunity on Sunday to lift their first ATP Masters 1000 trophy in Cincinnati.  Entering the semi-finals, World No. 1 Novak Djokovic appeared en route to claiming his 34th title at this level. But Medvedev upset the Serbian for the second time this year to set a rematch of a five-set thriller he lost against Goffin at Wimbledon last month.  “I try to take every match, no matter who I'm playing, the same,” Medvedev said. “I don't feel any extra pressure or [take] any extra confidence that I'm playing Goffin and not, for example, Rafa. But probably in percentage changes, yes, I have a better chance to win against David than against Rafa, but it does not mean that I cannot lose.”  This time a week ago, the Russian was preparing for his first Masters 1000 final at the Coupe Rogers in Montreal. Medvedev mustered only three games against Rafael Nadal, who triumphed in 70 minutes.  But instead of getting deflated this week, Medvedev has shown no drop-off at all. Instead, he is into his third ATP Tour final in as many weeks (Washington, Montreal, Cincinnati), becoming the first player to accomplish the feat since Alexander Zverev last year (Munich, Madrid, Rome).  “I think I will need to play aggressively, especially remembering my match in Wimbledon against David. I felt that I couldn't keep up with his consistency when he's in great shape,” Medvedev said. “At one moment I stepped up my game kind of like today with aggression and I almost won the match, though I lost it, and I think I'm going to have to be aggressive tomorrow.”  Medvedev speaks of their three-hour, 31-minute battle at SW19 just last month. The 23-year-old was up a break at 4-1 in the decider. But the former World No. 7 stormed back for the victory, eventually reaching the quarter-finals.  “It was an amazing feeling. But I felt that I was a little bit, I think, the better player during the whole match,” Goffin said at the time. “If you see all the rallies and how I felt during the match, I was feeling good and during the rallies I was a little bit more aggressive. But you never know with a player like Daniil, who sometimes is aggressive in just a few points, and then he serves, and then a few aces [and it] could be 4-1 like in the fifth. But I felt like I had the game and the shots to come back. Physically I was feeling great, as well. So I had the energy to fight, to come back.”  It will be interesting to see how big Medvedev goes on his second serves against Goffin. That proved a deciding factor against Djokovic, and the Russian said he did the same thing against the Belgian at Wimbledon, too.  Earlier in the year, at the Australian Open, Medvedev defeated Goffin in straight sets. So entering Sunday, their FedEx ATP Head2Head series is knotted at 1-1. Medvedev has shown tremendous form on hard courts in 2019, with his Djokovic win marking his 30th on the surface this year, which is 10 more than anyone else on the ATP Tour.  Goffin has shown plenty of prowess on hard courts, too, earning the best result of his career at The O2 in London two years ago, when he advanced to the championship match of the Nitto ATP Finals. The 28-year-old is the first Belgian to reach a Masters 1000 final, and he can jump into eighth place in the ATP Race To London if he wins his first crown since 2017 Tokyo and fifth ATP Tour title overall.  “I'm just focussed on what I have to do step by step. I’ll try to do my best. I try to win every match, and then we see at the end,” Goffin said. “To reach the first Masters 1000 [final] for a Belgian, of course for such a small country it's really nice.”",Daniil Medvedev won Cincinnati in 2019.
Who won Shanghai in 2019?,"Monumental changes can happen in a year on the ATP Tour. Fifth seed Alexander Zverev was the highest-ranked player on Tour under age 24 just 12 months ago, but third seed Daniil Medvedev has assumed that role with his inspired tennis this season. The pair will add a new chapter to their budding rivalry when they meet on Sunday in the championship match of the Rolex Shanghai Masters.  “I did say before this year and during this year in the beginning that Sascha was the best in our [age] group. He won three [ATP] Masters [1000 titles] when none of us were even close to doing this,” Medvedev said. “The positions have changed a little bit, so I think I can contest him now.”  When it comes to FedEx ATP Head2Head rivalries, numbers can sometimes be deceiving. Zverev holds a flawless 4-0 record over Medvedev and will take extra confidence from all of their matches being contested on hard courts. But their most recent clash came last year in Toronto, when Medvedev was a qualifier sitting at No. 68 in the ATP Rankings.  Fourteen months later, Medvedev arrived in Shanghai as the more in-form player between the pair. He’s at a career-high standing of No. 4 in the ATP Rankings and has added five additional ATP Tour titles on his resume since their Toronto meeting, including his first ATP Masters 1000 crown in Cincinnati (d. Goffin) and maiden Grand Slam final at the US Open (l. to Nadal). He's also through to his sixth consecutive tour-level final and is only the fifth active player to achieve the feat. “He's different this year than he was the previous years. The last time we played was in Toronto last year. So still a while ago, and he's been playing some unbelievable tennis,” Zverev said. “In the past few months, he's probably the best player in the world, making it to six finals in a row, winning an [ATP] Masters [1000 title], making it to the US Open final. He's definitely been playing the best tennis of his life.”  The 23-year-old Medvedev continues to add to his astounding season. He has more wins (58) and more appearances in finals (9) than anyone else on Tour this year. The Russian has prevailed in 28 of his past 31 matches and is currently on an eight-match winning streak, all of which have come in straight sets. Medvedev believes his progress this season will enable him to approach Sunday’s final against Zverev with a clean slate. “I think the [record] doesn’t mean anything. It's a new match, new situations,” Medvedev said. “This year, I had a lot of matches against opponents I don't like. I remember one against Lucas Pouille. I was 4-0 down in the [FedEx ATP Head2Head] series and still won the match in Queen’s Club.”  Medvedev’s return game has been on point and will need to be equally impressive against Zverev. The third seed converted 10 of 21 break point chances this week, but Zverev’s serve is the toughest he’ll face in Shanghai. Merely blocking a return back will result in a prompt winner from the German. Although Zverev is the first to admit that portions of his season haven’t met his lofty standards, he is back to his best tennis in Shanghai. The German scored his first Top 10 victory in a thrilling quarter-final over Roger Federer and put on a dominant display in his semi-final win over Matteo Berrettini,.  The fifth seed dropped just seven points on serve (40/47) against the Italian and didn’t face a break point. It’s a stark contrast to the serving woes he experienced during the North American hard-court swing, which included 20 double faults in his Cincinnati loss to #NextGenATP Serbian Miomir Kecmanovic. But Medvedev possesses a far different style of play to Zverev’s previous two opponents. Zverev beat Federer and Berrettini to the punch in battles of first-strike tennis, but will need to be more patient against Medvedev and accept that the Russian will retrieve many shots that would be winners against most players.  Sunday’s final will also be crucial for Zverev as he looks to qualify for the season-ending Nitto ATP Finals, held from 10-17 November at The O2 in London. Zverev, the defending champion, is currently seventh place in the ATP Race to London (2,855) and holds a healthy lead over eighth-placed Berrettini (2,525). He’ll pick up an additional 400 points with a win over Medvedev.",Daniil Medvedev won Shanghai in 2019.
Who won Paris in 2019?,"Novak Djokovic and Denis Shapovalov have played the first three matches in their budding FedEx ATP Head2Head rivalry this year. But when they clash on Sunday, the stakes will be higher than ever.  Djokovic and Shapovalov will compete for the Rolex Paris Masters title. For the Serbian, a four-time champion in Bercy, this is an opportunity to claw closer to Rafael Nadal in the battle for the year-end No. 1 ATP Ranking. Shapovalov is not just trying to spoil that opportunity for the top seed, but he is trying to claim his maiden ATP Masters 1000 crown in his first final at this level.  “It's awesome to be in my first [Masters 1000] final,” Shapovalov said. “I'm just going to go for it, see what I can do and just enjoy my time out there.” Shapovalov has won just one of eight sets he has played against Djokovic, and that came in a four-set defeat at the Australian Open. But Djokovic knows that the big-hitting Canadian has the ability to challenge him with his powerful game.  “Denis is very dangerous player. If he has time, if he's feeling the ball well, it can be a tough match,” Djokovic said after a 6-3, 6-3 victory against Shapovalov less than a month ago in Shanghai. “He was serving really well, [making a] high percentage of first serves, and [it was] just really difficult to return in the first set, so it took me a little bit of time to really adjust [and] start reading his serve a little bit better.” Djokovic is not just in a battle for year-end No. 1 with Nadal, who withdrew from Paris on Saturday before his semi-final due to an abdominal injury. But Djokovic can also win his 34th Masters 1000 title — in his 50th final at this level — which would put him within one of Nadal’s 35 trophies. It would also be the ninth time he has earned at least five tour-level crowns in a season.  “It is very satisfying honestly, because I haven’t really been feeling my best throughout the week. But I’ve been playing really well the past couple of matches,” Djokovic said. “[I am] looking forward to the final tomorrow.”  Although the pair’s second clash was on the Roman clay of the Internazionali BNL d’Italia, which doesn't match up with this meeting's surface, Djokovic made note of the length of the Canadian’s swing. And on Paris’ quicker indoor courts, where the Serbian will have more opportunities to take time away from his opponent, he will likely try to take advantage of that.  “He has a big swing. He can play really with a lot of spin and also a lot of speed and power from the back of the court,” Djokovic said in Rome. “I took away that time from him.” Shapovalov has far more momentum this week than he did during the clay-court season, though. The lefty not only won his first ATP Tour title indoors last month in Stockholm, but he has showed a balance of both shotmaking and patience this week in Paris. On Friday, Shapovalov conceded just four games against Gael Monfils in a match that had a spot at the Nitto ATP Finals on the line for the Frenchman.  “It's going to be a different match. But of course I feel like the way I played against Gael was unbelievable. It was kind of one of those days where everything was going in for me. So I hope I can bring the same kind of level that I did against him,” Shapovalov said. “But at the same time, Novak is a different player. So it's going to be a different kind of game and it's going to be different tennis.”  One area to watch will be where Djokovic targets his second serves. In his semi-final win against Grigor Dimitrov, he went to Dimitrov's forehand with 72 per cent of his second serves in the deuce court — compared to just 25 per cent in his quarter-final against Stefanos Tsitsipas. Shapovalov this week said that with his coach, Mikhail Youzhny, they have been working on blocking his backhand return. “[On my backhand return, Youzhny and I] worked on blocking it a lot more to start the point and it's a tricky shot for the opponents,” Shapovalov said. “I feel like it's a really big improvement in my game.”  Shapovalov was unequivocal in stating that he will go for his shots against Djokovic, believing he has nothing to lose. But a victory would mean national history, too, as he can become the first Canadian to lift a Masters 1000 trophy.  Even though he knows playing Djokovic is a tall order, Shapovalov feels he has learnt from his losses against the Serbian this season.  “I feel like every time I get a little more and more input on how he plays. I think when he played me in Shanghai, he played absolutely amazing. I don't think I played bad at all, but he was coming up with amazing shots,” Shapovalov said. “Hopefully he's missing a little bit more tomorrow, a little bit tighter. But hopefully I can also step up my game and play the way I've been playing all week.” Shapovalov as a 3-13 record against Top 10 opposition (2-6 this year). Djokovic has the same number of Masters 1000 titles as the Canadian has match wins at this level (33).",Novak Djokovic won Paris in 2019.
Who won Indian Wells in 2018?,"It’s a dream final at the BNP Paribas Open – for more than just fans.  Earlier in the tournament, Juan Martin del Potro said that any chance to play against Roger Federer would be great – and now he’ll get exactly that: a clash with Federer for the first ATP World Tour Masters 1000 trophy of the season. Both advanced to the final, albeit in drastically different fashion. Federer endured an inspired effort by Borna Coric, who led by a set and a break on several occasions but was unable to close the Swiss out in the match’s most tense moments. Del Potro, on the other hand, breezed by Milos Raonic, dealing better with the windy conditions and breaking the Canadian's normally potent serve four times. The victory marked Del Potro’s 400th career win, and he became just the second Argentine in history after Guillermo Vilas to reach the milestone. The BNP Paribas final pits two of the game’s best forehands against each other. With Del Potro, every ball left for his forehand to devour could mean the point is over. Whether he’s in an attacking position or a defensive one, the Argentine's juggernaut forehand is a weapon any opponent, including Federer, would wish to avoid.   Federer, on the other hand, will look to use his own potent forehand to bully Del Potro’s backhand. Taking the ball fast and early is the Swiss’ modus operandi, and his ability to inject so much spin with such a compact swing has contributed to countless historic results in his prolific career. This matchup of fearsome forehands has yielded several exceptional matches over the years. In fact, 9 of their past 11 meetings have gone to a final set, including an epic 19-17 third set at the London Olympics in 2012. Just last year, the two met four times: Federer claimed three of those matches, while Del Potro got the better of him in the quarter-finals of the US Open in four tight sets.  “Yeah, we have had a lot of close matches. Big matches, close matches,” recalled Federer on the rivalry. “I just tried to think back at the French Open semis, US Open final, Olympic semis, Basel finals ... and few [Nitto ATP Finals] matches, Shanghai; just three-setters and five-setters the whole way. It's been good.  “I think we have an interesting matchup,” he added. We both know what the other is trying to do, and we try to stop the other person from doing it. But it's hard when [one of us] is in full flight. It's basically an arm wrestle the whole time, and I think we enjoy that.”  Although Federer owns a 18-6 record against the 29-year-old in their FedEx ATP Head2Head series, Del Potro actually leads the Swiss when it comes to finals with three wins to Federer’s two. At the BNP Paribas Open, their 25th meeting overall will be their sixth final contested. Federer will be playing to reinforcehis place atop the ATP Rankings, although he will remain at the No. 1 spot throughout Miami regardless of his result in Sunday's final. Additionally, the 36-year-old is chasing his 28th ATP World Tour Masters 1000 title and 98th title overall.  Perhaps somewhat surprisingly, the final is a chance for Del Potro to claim his first ATP World Tour Masters 1000 trophy and his biggest title since winning the US Open nine years ago. The Argentine knows he won’t have it easy against one of his greatest rivals – but he relishes the challenge.  “We play great matches together. I love to play against him,” said the World No. 8. “He's the favourite to win tomorrow, but I will try to do my best tennis. I beat him in the past, and I know [what] I can do to repeat that, but is not easy. It will be a good challenge to see how my level is against him.”",Juan Martin Del Potro won Indian Wells in 2018.
Who won Miami in 2018?,"If someone told you that a player who lost his first match at the BNP Paribas Open and another who had two wins on the season entering the Miami Open presented by Itau would meet for the Miami title on Sunday, would you have believed them? Probably not.  But Alexander Zverev and John Isner have earned their places in the championship match at the second ATP World Tour Masters 1000 event of the year, and one of them will leave Crandon Park having made a major statement in the tournament's last match at the facility. Zverev had not had a bad season by any means, arriving in Florida with an 8-4 record. But three of the German’s four losses came against players outside of the Top 50 in the ATP Rankings. For someone who won five ATP World Tour titles — including two Masters 1000 trophies (Rome, Montreal) — last season, it was not the most inspiring start to the year.  But after surviving a third-set tie-break in the second round against Sydney champion Daniil Medvedev, Zverev has found some of his best tennis. He had to in his next match against former World No. 3 David Ferrer, who played at an extremely high level to take the first set before the German’s game became too overwhelming. Zverev has not lost a set since, ousting No. 17 Nick Kyrgios, Indian Wells semi-finalist Borna Coric and No. 16 Pablo Carreno Busta.  “I think I'm playing okay. I'm playing well now,” Zverev said. “Hopefully I can continue so in the final, and we'll see how that goes.”  Across the net will be a familiar face in Isner. The American, who is into his fourth Masters 1000 final (0-3), has lost all three of his FedEx ATP Head2Head meetings against Zverev, including a Round of 16 heartbreaker against him last year. Isner was unable to convert on three match points in a three tie-break thriller against the current World No. 5, who Isner called after his semi-final “the best young player this game has”. But the 32-year-old has played by far his best tennis of the year on Key Biscayne. From the Round of 16 on, he beat World No. 2 Marin Cilic, reigning Next Gen ATP Finals champion Hyeon Chung and BNP Paribas Open champion Juan Martin del Potro — arguably the favourite in Miami — all in straight sets while facing just one break point (against Chung, which he saved).  “With my game, if I'm doing the right things, it doesn't really matter who I'm playing,” said Isner, who won the Indian Wells doubles title with Jack Sock. “I'm going to be very tough to beat.”  The key to the match will likely be Zverev’s second serve. Against Del Potro, Isner made it clear from the first ball that for better or for worse he was going to go after almost every one of the Argentine’s second deliveries, and it paid dividends. In 2017, the American won 41 per cent of second-serve return points, according to Infosys ATP Scores & Stats, but he won 45 per cent of those points against the most in-form player on the ATP World Tour on Friday.  In Isner's and Zverev's three previous FedEx ATP Head2Head meetings, Isner won just 39 per cent of second-serve return points against Zverev, while the German won 49 per cent of those points against arguably the best server in the sport. Entering Miami, Isner was third all-time in having won 56 per cent of his second-serve points.   The German will have to avoid letting the World No. 17 take the first cut at the ball in rallies and will need to elongate points as much as he can and keep Isner on the defencive, behind the baseline. If the 20-year-old can control the pace of play, a third Masters 1000 title may very well be within his reach. But if he allows the match to slip to Isner’s racquet, forehands may zoom by him like they did Del Potro. And while he has beaten the American three times, he will not be looking to his past success on Sunday. ""It's going to be a completely different match. I think he's going to hit a lot of aces, a lot of winners,"" Zverev said. ""But I'm ready for it, and hopefully it will be another great one.""  For Isner, it will be a successful tournament regardless of the result, as he will break back into the Top 10 of the ATP Rankings on Monday for the first time since May 2014 despite winning just two matches this year prior to Miami. But he hopes to complete his massive turnaround in form to claim his maiden Masters 1000 title after losing to Roger Federer, Rafael Nadal and Andy Murray in his first three finals at this level.  “If I'm not playing too confidently out there and not doing the right things on the court, I can be beaten by anybody, as well,” Isner said. “It's been a very streaky year so far, but I'm very happy to be on the good side of that streak right now.”",John Isner won Miami in 2018.
Who won Monte Carlo in 2018?,"Rafael Nadal and Kei Nishikori have been waiting for this moment for a long time.  On Sunday, the Spaniard and the Japanese will square off in the Rolex Monte-Carlo Masters final, with the prestigious tournament crowning its 112th champion. Along the pristine shores of the Mediterranean, a historic title awaits the winner in the Principality.  One year after completing 'La Decima' at the ATP World Tour Masters 1000 event, Nadal vies for an unprecedented 11th title at one of his clay-court playgrounds. Meanwhile, Nishikori is hoping to complete his quest for a maiden Masters 1000 crown and claim a slice of history of his own, as the first Asian-born player to lift a trophy at the level.  But, records and accolades aside, the final takes on added significance considering the state of both players' games just a few months ago. With both on the comeback trail from injury, Nadal and Nishikori will take many positives from their stays at the Monte-Carlo Country Club. While a leg ailment had sidelined the top-seeded Spaniard for three months, since retiring from his Australian Open quarter-final, the unseeded Japanese is also bidding to return to top form after struggling with a wrist injury in 2017. For Nadal, his week in Monte-Carlo was so impressive, even the Spaniard himself was surprised by his ruthless run. After pulling out of three straight tournaments, in Paris and London to conclude 2017 and Melbourne in January, the Manacor native is back with a vengeance. Nadal extended his clay-court sets won streak to a personal-best 34 in a row following a 6-4, 6-1 rout of Grigor Dimitrov on Saturday. He has lost a mere 16 games in four matches this week, dominating Aljaz Bedene, Karen Khachanov, Dominic Thiem and the fourth-seeded Dimitrov en route to the final. It's his fewest games dropped in Monte-Carlo since 2010, when he lost 13.  ""With Kei, we had a lot of good matches in our career,"" said Nadal on Saturday. ""It's going to be a tough match. I know I have to play at my best to keep having real chances of success. It is an important match for me tomorrow. But still, to be in the final already after a period outside of the courts is great news for me. Let's try to be ready for tomorrow. Let's try to play a great match and give me another chance.""  One loss and Nadal will concede the top spot in the ATP Rankings to Roger Federer, after returning to the summit earlier this month. But he has showed no intentions of letting his grasp on the No. 1 mantle slip on his preferred surface. And not only is Nadal bidding to lift his 11th trophy in the Principality, he is also looking to return to the summit on the ATP World Tour Masters 1000 titles list. Currently tied with Novak Djokovic with 30 crowns apiece, No. 31 would see him stand alone in first place.  On Sunday, Nadal will look to extend his FedEx ATP Head2Head advantage over Nishikori, which currently stands at 9-2. Despite falling in their most recent meeting, for the bronze medal at the 2016 Summer Olympics, he has not lost in three encounters on clay. Two of those clashes came in finals as well, at the 2014 Mutua Madrid Open and 2016 Barcelona Open Banc Sabadell.   ""Tomorrow is a different opponent,"" said Nishikori. ""He's been dominating like crazy this week. I know it's going to be tough. For me, I think I'm improving every match. I feel very confident right now.  ""Rafa has been hitting very, very heavy, especially his forehand. His backhand also. He's been playing very solid this week. I'm sure there is a way to beat him. But, to see him this week, it looks little bit difficult.""  Arriving at this moment is an achievement in itself for Nishikori, who entered the week with just four wins from seven matches on the ATP World Tour this year. But, after reaching his fourth ATP World Tour Masters 1000 final and first in Monte-Carlo, the Japanese star took a massive step in the right direction in his comeback from a wrist injury. A quartet of three-set wins over Tomas Berdych, Andreas Seppi, Marin Cilic and Alexander Zverev will give Nishikori great confidence in his durability going forward. The Shimane native is eyeing a first Masters 1000 title after falling to Novak Djokovic in both the Miami and Toronto finals in 2016, and suffering a three-set defeat to Nadal in Madrid four years ago. Not only would he become the first from Japan to claim victory at the elite level, but also the first Asian-born player to achieve the feat.  Nishikori is also hoping to continue the trend for first-time Masters 1000 champions. Victory for the 28-year-old would make him the fourth straight first-time winner, following Jack Sock in Paris last year and Juan Martin del Potro and John Isner in Indian Wells and Miami last month. He is also looking to continue the streak for non-European titlists, marking the longest such run in Masters 1000 history.   And Nishikori's historic bid does not stop there. A win on Sunday would make him the first player to lift trophies on both the ATP Challenger Tour and at the ATP World Tour Masters 1000 level in a single season. He will have his shot at cementing his place in the record books after triumphing at the RBC Tennis Championships of Dallas in February.  The stage is set for another gripping final on the red dirt. With plenty at stake, expect nothing short of a heavyweight fight for the trophy.",Rafael Nadal won Monte Carlo in 2018.
Who won Madrid in 2018?,"For Dominic Thiem, Sunday's Mutua Madrid Open final against Alexander Zverev will be a chance to become a fully-fledged member of the game's current elite.  Thiem, the No. 7 player in the ATP Rankings, has been in the Top 10 since June 2016, after reaching his maiden Grand Slam semi-final at Roland Garros (l. to Djokovic), and he has twice qualified for the season-ending Nitto ATP Finals in London (2016, 2017). But Thiem has never won an ATP World Tour Masters 1000 event.  “A Masters 1000 title would mean a lot to me because it's obviously really tough to win one,” Thiem said. For Alexander Zverev, the match is an opportunity to shout, once more, that he is on his way to challenging the best who have picked up a racquet. On Sunday, the 21-year-old can become just the fifth active player to win three Masters 1000 crowns, joining the “Big Four” of Rafael Nadal, Roger Federer, Novak Djokovic and Andy Murray.  “It's obviously a great final for the future ahead,” Zverev, 21, said of facing Thiem, 24.  Last year, Thiem fell to Nadal in the Madrid final, his only prior Masters 1000 title match. But earlier this week, the right-hander dispatched Nadal in the quarter-finals, snapping the Spaniard's 50-set and 21-match clay win streaks for his third win (3-6) against the No. 1 player in the ATP Rankings. The Austrian right-hander owns a far more favourable FedEx ATP Head2Head record against Zverev, who's playing in his fourth Masters 1000 final (2017 Rome, Montreal; 2018 Miami) and second of the season. Thiem has beaten Zverev four of the five times they've played, including all three on clay. But it's been two years since they last played on red dirt, 2016 Roland Garros, when Thiem won in four sets. At the time, Zverev was 19 and had never reached an ATP World Tour final, let alone a title match at a Masters 1000 event. Since then, however, the No. 3 player in the ATP Rankings has won five ATP World Tour titles and two Masters 1000 crowns, including the 2017 Internazionali BNL d'Italia title in Rome, when he dismissed Novak Djokovic in straight sets.  “We played five times against each other when he was already Top 10, and I was more in the developing stage still. Obviously he's leading the head-to-head,” Zverev said. The German won his eighth straight match in order to reach his third final of the season. Zverev also won four consecutive times last week at the BMW Open by FWU in Munich to celebrate his first title of the year.  The 6'6” right-hander has yet to drop serve this week in Madrid, and he hasn't faced a break point since his third-round match against Argentina's Leonardo Mayer. Zverev dismissed Miami Open presented by Itau champion John Isner and #NextGenATP Canadian Denis Shapovalov in straight sets in the quarter-finals and semi-finals, respectively. “I'm playing quite well. So is he. Hopefully it will be another entertaining one,” Zverev said of Sunday's final.  Thiem, however, should have more confidence than anyone, having done what few thought would happen this week by beating Nadal, the five-time champion in Madrid. It's the second time Thiem has beaten Nadal in straight sets on clay in as many years. The Austrian also defeated Nadal in the 2017 Rome quarter-finals.  “It gave me a huge boost of confidence,” Thiem said of his Madrid quarter-final victory. But he didn't walk into Caja Magica on Saturday and expect Kevin Anderson to give him the semi-final. Thiem had never beaten Anderson in their six prior FedEx ATP Head2Head matchups, but they had never played on clay, Thiem's surface of choice.  “I was keeping my level up from yesterday, so that was a great thing. The way I started was also well,” Thiem said. “Almost everything worked out. To beat him [6-4, 6-2], it's a very good result.”  Another good showing on Sunday would place Thiem alongside Juan Martin del Potro as first-time Masters 1000 titlists in 2018. Del Potro celebrated his maiden Masters 1000 title in Indian Wells (d. Federer).  The win would also mark Thiem's second title of the season (Buenos Aires). “To be honest, I thought that I was pretty far away before this week started,” Thiem said. “Now I'm in the finals again, which is amazing for me.”",Alexander Zverev won Madrid in 2018.
Who won Toronto in 2018?,"World No. 1 Rafael Nadal became the first player to guarantee his spot at the Nitto ATP Finals on Friday. And now, the Spaniard has a chance to lift his fifth trophy of the year on Sunday in the Rogers Cup final. But it will not be easy for the top seed, with red-hot #NextGenATP Greek Stefanos Tsitsipas trying to earn his maiden tour-level crown.  History will be made regardless of the outcome. The Spaniard will extend his record count of ATP World Tour Masters 1000 titles to 33, or Tsitsipas will claim his fifth consecutive victory against a Top 10 opponent. Since the inception of the ATP Rankings on 23 August 1973, no player has claimed an ATP World Tour title by beating five Top 10 opponents outside of the Nitto ATP Finals. It’s fitting that the pair’s first and only previous FedEx ATP Head2Head meeting came in a final earlier this year at the Barcelona Open Banc Sabadell, which was Tsitsipas’ first championship match at tour-level. Albeit on clay, Nadal asserted his authority, breaking five times in a 78-minute beatdown.  ""Tsitsipas has an amazing future,” Nadal said after the match. But even the Spaniard wouldn’t have expected the Greek, whose 20th birthday is today, to rise so quickly. The week he reached the final in Spain, Tsitsipas was No. 63 in the ATP Rankings. Less than four months later, he will climb to at least No. 15 on Monday, with only 16 points to defend through the US Open.  Tsitsipas can also become the youngest Masters 1000 champion since Novak Djokovic (19) triumphed at Miami in 2007 and the first player to claim his maiden tour-level trophy at this level since Albert Portas (2001 Hamburg). But the Greek is not overthinking the opportunity at hand. He’s maintaining the same approach that has helped him come to a simple conclusion after saving match point to beat South African Kevin Anderson in a third-set tie-break in the semi-finals: ‘I'm living the dream’.  “[It’s] just another day at the office. Doesn't matter. It's a final. I will not see it as a final. I will just think of it as just another match here in Toronto in a beautiful city,” Tsitsipas said. “I'm doing my routines every single day. So just one more day, the last day… [I’ll give it] my best shot, go for it 100 per cent and see what happens.” It certainly won’t be an easy task against Nadal, who is trying to join Jimmy Connors, Roger Federer and Ivan Lendl as the only players in the Open Era with 80 titles (79-36 in finals). The 32-year-old can also win his fourth Rogers Cup, a feat he has never accomplished at any other hard-court event. Nadal has triumphed at the US Open, the Canadian Masters 1000 event and the BNP Paribas Open three times each.  But that’s not all that’s at stake for the left-hander. After exchanging World No. 1 with Roger Federer six times in the first six months of the season, Nadal has an opportunity to strengthen his lead, which was 2,230 points over the Swiss entering the week. Federer, who did not compete this week, was defending 600 points from his runner-up finish in Canada last year, while Nadal earned just 90 points in 2017 for reaching the third round (l. to Shapovalov). The player who lifts the title will add 1,000 points to their total.  It will be interesting to see how Nadal reacts to Tsitsipas' powerful and accurate inside-in forehand, which has done the most damage for the Greek in wins against Dominic Thiem, Novak Djokovic, Alexander Zverev and Anderson. Nadal is as fleet of foot as they come, but this meeting is on a much quicker surface than the red dirt they played on earlier in the year.   “He's a complex player. He has everything. He's young, he has passion for the game. He has a great forehand, great backhand, good serve, so he's not about one thing. He's about everything,” Nadal said. “These kind of matches you need to play very well to win, and that's what I'm going to try.”  After their last clash, in the Barcelona final, Tsitsipas said, ""I knew the chances to win were small.”  It is clear the gap has narrowed since. But will it be enough for the #NextGenATP star to conquer one of tennis’ toughest tests?",Rafael Nadal won Toronto in 2018.
Who won Cincinnati in 2018?,"Since lifting his eighth unique ATP World Tour Masters 1000 trophy at the 2013 Rolex Monte-Carlo Masters, Novak Djokovic has stood one title away from becoming the first man to achieve the Career Golden Masters. For the second time since that victory in the Principality, the 31-year-old is just one win away from achieving that feat by winning the Western & Southern Open. But, as was the case in 2015, Roger Federer stands in the way.  Three years ago, Federer defeated Djokovic for the third time in Cincinnati's championship match (also 2009, 2012) without dropping a set to claim the title. The seven-time champion will be aiming to extend his unbeaten record in Cincinnati finals by winning his 15th consecutive match at the Ohio-based event. Despite meeting on 45 occasions in their FedEx ATP Head2Head series (Djokovic leads 23-22), the great rivals will face off for the first time in 31 months on Sunday. And that has Federer excited.  ""What's nice about this, it's like fresh,"" Federer said. ""It's not like we have played in the last few weeks and everybody knows what to expect. A lot has happened since [our last meeting] with injuries both of us have been fighting, and we both came back strong again.""  In their last meeting at the 2016 Australian Open, Djokovic defeated Federer in four sets to reach his sixth final at the opening Grand Slam of the season.And while it will present challenges for the Swiss in today's final, he is happy to see his great rival back from an elbow injury and playing some of his best tennis like when they met 2 1/2 years ago in Melbourne.   ""When they asked me in Indian Wells and Miami to judge Novak, I was, like, It's not real Novak. He was just coming back, and he came back too soon. Same at the Australian Open. That one wasn't quite the 100% Novak we know he can be.  ""Look what happened after the French. Everything turned. He could have won Queen's, should have won Queen's, maybe. Ends up winning Wimbledon and he's back in another final. It looks like he hasn't missed any tennis at all over the last few years.""  Both men will be keen to end their relative title droughts at Masters 1000 level. Djokovic last achieved success at the level two years ago at the Rogers Cup, while Federer's most recent triumph came at the 2017 Rolex Shanghai Masters. Djokovic (30) and Federer (27) will also be eager to narrow the gap on all-time Masters 1000 title record holder Nadal, who won his 33rd title at the level last week in Toronto.   Bidding to win his 70th tour-level trophy, Djokovic will need to find his best level in the championship match. The five-time runner-up is yet to win a set in a Cincinnati final. Only three men have lost five or more finals at a tour-level event without winning the title, with Andy Murray and Nadal both sharing the same record at the Australian Open and Miami Open presented by Itaú, respectively.  Since his arrival at the Internazionali BNL d'Italia in May, Djokovic has clinched victory in 26 of his 30 tour-level matches. But the Wimbledon champion has been pushed all the way in Cincinnati. After a straight-sets win over Steve Johnson in the first round, Djokovic has needed deciding sets in each of his four encounters against Adrian Mannarino, Grigor Dimitrov, Milos Raonic and Marin Cilic.   Competing for the first time since his quarter-final exit to Kevin Anderson at Wimbledon, Federer has continually impressed on serve this week. The 37-year-old has held each of his 43 service games en route to the final, facing only five break points along the way.  But Federer has been significantly tested. The 98-time tour-level titlist came to within two points of defeat at 6-7(2), 6-6 (6/6) against countryman Stan Wawrinka in the quarter-finals before clinching victory in three sets. Four of Federer's nine sets this week have required tie-breaks.   With title runs in his two most recent appearances in 2014 and 2015, Federer's last loss at this event came in 2013 to eventual champion Nadal at the quarter-final stage. Federer, who began his career with a 1-4 record in Cincinnati, has lost just four of his most recent 49 matches at the Lindner Family Tennis Center.  Can Djokovic finally complete his set of Masters 1000 trophies or will Federer, once again, deny Djokovic in the championship match to extend his unbeaten record in Cincinnati finals?",Novak Djokovic won Cincinnati in 2018.
